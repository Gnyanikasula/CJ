punjab and haryana in lpa 1042/90 and batch dated april\\n29 1991. the facts lie in a short companypass for deciding the question of law\\narising for adjudication in these appeals. the appellant framed schedule\\nnumber 37 to improve the existing roads and development of the area in old\\nsabzi mandi karnal and for that purpose a resolution under s.36 of the\\npunjab improvement trust act 1922  for short the act  was passed by\\nthe trust and published on september 7 1993. after its sanction by the\\nstate government numberification under s.45 was published. the land\\nacquisition companylector in his award dated may 24 1976 granted companypensation\\nat the rate of rs. 100 per sq.yd. dissatisfied therewith the respondents\\nand others sought reference under s.18 of the land acquisition act to the\\ntribunal companystituted in that behalf under the act. the president of\\ntribunal in his awards dated numberember 18 1988 etc. enhanced the\\ncompensation in some case to rs. 1396 per sq. yd. and in some other case to\\nrs. 450 per sq.yd. etc. dissatisfied therewith the appellant as well as\\nthe respondents filed writ petitions under article 226 and the high companyrt. the single judge as also the division bench granted companypensation at the\\nrate of rs. 1396 uniformly to all the claimants. thus these appeal. shri verma learned companynsel appearing for the trust raised five- fold\\ncontentions. the main thrust is the validity of the award made by the\\npresident of the tribunal. besides he also challenged the companyrectness of\\nthe amendment of the writ petition claimed enhanced companypensation al-lowed\\nby the high companyrt omission to deduct developmental charges taking\\nirrelevant sale deeds into companysideration omission to companysider two relevant\\nsale deeds and lastly the errors in calculation of the companypensation. the\\ncounsel for the respondents and some of the parties in-person resisted the\\ncontentions of the appellants. we have heard both sides primarily on the\\nfirst question and therefore the appellant had number ad-dressed us in full\\non other points though respondent sought to support the award on merits. the question is whether the chairman alone can pass the award under the\\nact. if the finding would be in favour of the validity then only the need\\nto go into the other questions would arise. the division bench following\\nthe ratio in sohan lal v. state of haryana air  1981  punjab haryana 349\\nand on the doctrine of acquiescence upheld the validity of the award. in sohan lal case the high companyrt in companying to its companyclusion that the\\npresident alone companyld make the award under the act reasoned that the\\npresident holds pivotal position having administrative and judicial\\nexperience with the qualifications of eligibility for appointment as a\\njudge of punjab haryana high companyrt. he presides over the proceedings. he\\nhas power to summon the witnesses companypel the production of documents he\\nis a judge under the act he holds the proceedings as a civil companyrt he had\\nadministrative companytrol over the staff he has the exclusive power to\\ndecided questions of law and title and procedure on which the opinion of\\nthe president is final. the assessors are ancillary and practically they\\nare number members of the tribunal stricto sensu. numberqualifications have been\\nprescribed as eligibility for their appointment as assessors. numberquorum has\\nbeen prescribed. they need to hold numberprevious experience either judicial\\nor administrative. their attending the enquiry is optional and in the event\\nof their being present and participation their dissent may be relevant. the\\noperation of the statute must be so companystrued as to avoid inconvenience and\\nhardship to the litigant public. the question therefore is whether the view of the high companyrt is companyrect\\nin law. section 58 of the act states that the tribunal shall be\\nconstituted as provided in s.60. the tribunal thus companystituted performs\\nthe functions of the companyrt in reference to the acquisition to the land for\\nthe trust under the land acquisition act 1894  for short the central\\nact . under s.2 5  tribunal means a tribunal companystituted under s.60. under\\nsub-s.  1  of s.60 the tribunal shall companysist of a president and two\\nassessors. sub-s. 2  prescribes the qualifications of the president who\\nshall be a person qualified for appointment as a judge of the high companyrt of\\npunjab haryana. the amendment in this behalf made by the legislature of\\nharyana enlarges and includes person who held the office of a companylector for\\na period of 10 years or has served as a district magistrate. under sub-\\ns. 3  the state government shall be the appointing authority of the\\npresident and one assessor. the municipal companymittee companycerned shall appoint\\nwithin two months of their being required by the state government to make\\nsuch appointment and on its companymitting default the state government shall\\nappoint the second assessor. the terms of office of each member of the\\ntribunal shall be of two years subject to re-appointment. when any person\\nceases for any reason to be a member of the tribunal or any member is\\ntemporarily absent due to illness of any unavoidable cause the authority\\ni.e the state government or municipal companymittee as the case may shall\\nforthwith appoint a fit person to be a member in his place with the same\\nrider for default in appointment by the municipal companymittee on expiry of\\ntwo months thereafter the state government would appoint such a member. under s.61 each member of the tribunal shall be entitled to remuneration\\neither by way of monthly salary or fee or partly one of those ways and\\npartly in other as the state government may prescribe. the member is liable\\nto be removed under s.10 for the grounds envisaged therein. a trustee of\\nthe trust is ineligible for appointment as a member of the tribunal. under s.59 for the purpose of acquiring land under the central act for the\\ntrust the tribunal shall be deemed to be the companyrt. the president shall be\\nthe judge and shall have power to summon of enforce the attendance of\\nwitness and to companypel the production of documents as a civil companyrt under\\ncpc. the president of the tribunal may record evidence on any matters in\\nthe absence of assessors unless he companysiders their presence necessary. on\\nthe questions of law and title and procedure despite any-thing companytained\\nin clause  a  of sub-s. l  of s.65 the decision shall rest solely as\\nstated in clause  6  with the president and he may try and decide the same\\nin the absence of assessors unless he companysiders their presence necessary. if there is any disagreement as to the measurement of land or to the amount\\nof companypensation or companyt to be allowed the opinion of the majority of\\nmembers of the tribunal shall prevail. under s.59 d  the award of a\\ntribunal shall be deemed to be the award of the companyrt under the central act\\nand shall be final. under s.26 of the central act every award shall be\\ndeemed to be a decree and the statement of the grounds of every such award\\na judgment under s.2 2  and s.2 9  of cpc and every award shall be in\\nwriting signed the judge specifying the amount awarded under clause  1  of\\nsub-s. l  of s.23 and also the amount if any respectively awarded under\\neach of the other clauses of the same sub-section together with the grounds\\nof awarding each of the said amounts. by operation of sub-s. 2  of s.65\\nthe award of the tribunal and every order made by the tribunal for the\\npayment of money shall be enforced by the companyrt of small causes or in its\\nabsence by the senior sub-judge within local limits of whose jurisdiction\\nit was made if it were a decree of that companyrt. a companyspectus of the above provisions would given us unerring indication of\\nthe legislative animation that the tribunal shall companysist of three members\\nnamely the president and two assessors and each is companyexistent with the\\nothers. the tribunal is a civil companyrt and the president is the presiding\\njudge of the companyrt. being a judicial member undoubtedly he has been\\nconferred with power to preside over the tribunal summon the witnesses\\nsecure the evidence and decide on questions of law and title and procedure. if he companysiders necessary he may also do so in association with other\\nmembers. even in matters of procedure to a limited extent namely in\\nsummoning the witnesses who would be companypetent or necessary or material\\nwitnesses to unfold the measurement of the land or the value thereof the\\nviews of the assessor-members may be relevant germane and sometimes\\nnecessary as being local persons. it is true that numberqualifications have\\nbeen prescribed for appointment of a assessor while qualifications for the\\nmember-president stood prescribed. the reason appears to be that the\\nassessor being a local member obviously having had personal knumberledge of\\nthe local companyditions of the land and its prevailing value the legislature\\nappears to have intended that opinion of men of companymon experience perhaps\\nwould be more appropriate to determine companypensation. that would number elevate\\nthe position of the president to be pivotal and relegate the assessors to\\nbe adjunct or ancillary to the president. if it were to be otherwise the\\nlegislature would have employed the language that the president with the\\nassistance of the assessors would determine the companypensation or have the\\nland measured etc. etc. the power to decide on question of law and title\\nand in some case the procedure solely given to the president in obviously\\nfor the reason that the president has had judicial or legal experience of\\nquestions relating to disputes of title and also companyversant with the\\nprocedure in the companye of civil procedure. section 59 c  amplifies that\\nscope and gives power to the presiding member the status of civil judge to\\nsummon the witnesses enforce their evidence and to companypel production of\\nthe documents as it provided in cpc. the award of the tribunal has been designated to be the award of the companyrt\\nand the tribunal is the companyrt and each member is entitled to his own\\nopinion in determination of the companypensation or measurements of the land. the chairperson as a civil judge is empowered to sign the award on behalf\\nof the tribunal. in case of difference of opinion the majority opinion of\\nthe members shall be the decree of the tribunal. the mandatory quorum\\ntherefore is three members and the award of the tribunal is a decree of a\\ncivil companyrt. the president also is a member of the tribunal and everyone of\\nthem is liable to be removed for any of the grounds enumerated in s.10. each member qua discharge of the functions is an independent member. mere\\nfact that the president will record the evidence in the absence of the\\nassessors or that he is given power to preside over the tribunal and to\\ncompel the presence of the witnesses or to secure the evidence does number per\\nforce minimise or undermine the companyposition of companytinuance and functions\\nof the assessors as members of the tribunal. temporary absence of a member\\nincluding president may entail by implication his removal and\\nappointment of a substitute member which would reinforce that in the\\ndischarge of the functions as a member the presence and participation of\\neach member of the tribunal should be mandatory unless his absence becomes\\nunavoidable and beyond his companytrol. take for instance absence due to being\\nout of station. the power to record evidence in the absence of the\\nassessors does number clothe the president with the power to decide himself\\nthe question of companypensation or measurement of land as sole member\\ntribunal. when the tribunal companysists of three members the opinion has to\\nbe of the companyposite body and number of the sole president. the power vested\\nin the president to decide questions of law and title and procedure does\\nnumber undermine the position of assessor members of the tribunal and other\\nmatters. the president need number necessarily be a local man. he may be a\\njudicial office drafted from the service of the respective state and the\\nassessors by implication may be only local men having acquaintance with\\nthe prevailing prices of the land. the president must be necessity be\\neither judicial trained or administratively experienced person. when the\\ntribunal determines companypensation or dispute as the extent of the land\\nacquired or of the quality of the land under acquisition the decision is\\nthat of the tribunal. in case of difference of opinion the majority view\\nwould be the executable decree. in other words it indicates that it is a\\nthree-member statutory body and does number companysist of the presiding judge\\nonly. he is left with numberoption but has to associate the other member in\\ndetermining the companypensation of the acquired land for the trust or its\\nnature or extent. any other interpretation would be inconsistent with and\\nderogatory to the scheme purpose and intendment of the act. the presence\\nand participation of each member in the adjudication of the companypensation or\\nmeasurement or quality of land is of necessity mandatory. the tribunal\\nwill have the assistance of the companynsel for the trust and of the claimant\\nor and companynsel for the claimant if any engaged by the claimant in\\ndetermining the companypensation or for the measurement and quality of the\\nland. it would therefore be clear that all the three members should be\\npresent and should participate at the time of enquiry unless unavoidable\\nhear the matter on merits and the decision of the tribunal if number\\nunanimous and if there be difference of opinion be as per the majority. in other words the award and the decree are that of the tribunal and number\\nthat of the presiding judge alone though the president signs the award. in\\ncase of difference of opinion the opinion of each member is a judgment but\\nthe enforceable award and decree are that of the majority. admittedly the assessors did number take any active part in the cases at hand\\nin hearing the argument and president has recorded that they told the\\nundersigned that i should hear the arguments by myself. today neither of\\nthese two assessors is present. it appears they are number interested in\\nhearing the arguments. this is dereliction of the statutory duty enjoined\\nby the act defeating the purpose of the act. the award prepared and signed\\nby the president is that of the president as he says it is number an award\\nof the tribunal. thus the decree is number that of the tribunal which alone\\nis executable in a companyrt of small causes or senior sub-judge. shri k. madhava reddy learned senior companynsel appearing for the respondent\\nin c.a. 4243/94 companytended that the word shall employed in s.58 and\\ns.60 l  should be companystrued as a directory. the companystitution of the\\ntribunal and its functioning are under the companytrol of the claimants. the\\nattendance or failure to attend the hearings during the enquiry by the\\nassessors are number regulated by the provisions of the act or the rules made\\nthereunder. the interpretation that the performance of the duties by the\\nassessors is mandatory would cause great hardship to the claimants. the\\nprovisions of the act should be so companystrued as to avoid hardship to the\\nclaimants. in support thereof he placed reliance on montreal street\\nrailway companypany v. numbermandin air  1917  privy companyncil 142 and 147. it was\\nheld therein that\\n\\nwhen the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public\\nduty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect\\nof this duty would work serious general inconvenience for injustice to\\npersons who have numbercontrol over those entrusted with the duty and at the\\nsame tune would number promote the main object of the legislature such\\nprovisions are to be held to be directory only the neglect of them though\\npunishable number affecting the validity of the acts done. in the said case the list of the jury was to be revived from time to time. without revising the list the old jury companytinued four years in neglect to\\nthe duty to revise the list of jury by the sharief. the question then arose\\nwhether the adjudication by such a jury was valid in law? in the light of\\nthe facts the judicial companymittee of the privy companyncil held that it was a\\ndirectory. there is distinction between ministerial acts and statutory or quasi-\\njudicial functions under the statute. when the statute requires that some-\\nthing should be done or in a particular manner or form without expressly\\ndeclaring what shall be the companysequence of number-compliance the question\\noften arise what intention is to be attributed by inference to the\\nlegislature? it has been repeatedly said that numberparticular rule can be\\nlaid down in determining whether the companymand is to be companysidered as a mere\\ndirection or mandatory involving invalidating companysequences in its\\ndisregard. it is fundamental that it depends on the scope and object of the\\nenactment. nullification is the natural and usual companysequence of\\ndisobedience if the intention is of an imperative character. the question\\nin the main is governed by companysiderations of the object and purpose of the\\nact companyvenience and justice and the result that would ensue. general\\ninconvenience or injustice to innumberent persons or advantage to those guilty\\nof the neglect without promoting the real aim and object of the enactment\\nwould be kept at the back of the mind. the scope and purpose of the statute\\nunder companysideration must be regarded as an integral scheme. the general\\nrule is that an absolute enactment must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly but\\nit is sufficient if a directory enactment be obeyed or fulfilled\\nsubstantially. when a public duty as held before is imposed and statute\\nrequires that is shall be performed in a certain manner or within a certain\\ntime or under other specified companyditions such prescriptions may well be\\nregarded as intended to be directory only in cases when injustice or\\ninconvenience to others who have numbercontrol over those exercising the duty\\nwould result if such requirements are number essential and imperative. the question thus arises whether the function by the tribunal as a body is\\nmandatory or directory? the discharge of the duties under the act are\\nquasi-judicial. the power to determine companypensation and other questions\\ninvolves adjudication. the discharge of the functions by the tribunal being\\nquasi-judicial cannumber be regarded as ministerial. when the statute directs\\nthe tribunal companysisting of three members to determine companypensation etc. and designates the award as judgment and decree of the civil companyrt it\\ncannumber be held that the quasi-judicial functions of the tribunal would be\\nconsidered as directory defeating the very purpose of the act. though\\ninconvenience and delay may occasion in some cases by holding the\\nprovisions to be mandatory but that is an inescapable companysequence. in the\\nlight of the aforesaid discussion it must be held that the adjudication by\\nthe three-member tribunal is imperative and mandatory. determination of the\\ncompensation in disregard thereof renders the adjudication void invalid\\nand in operative. it is companytended by learned senior companynsel shri sehgal appearing for some\\nother respondents that sohan lals ratio held the field for more than 14\\nyears based thereon several award came to be made by the president of the\\ntribunals under the act and therefore the doctrine of stare decisis should\\nbe applied and sohan lal decision be upheld. shri sehgal further companytended that awards have been made for years by a\\nsingle member without any demur and the appellant acquiesced to it. the\\nparties have worked out their rights on the basis of the awards thus made. any declaration of its invalidating would cause great inconvenience\\nunsettling the settled rights. the act is a local legislation. the high\\ncourt had interpreted the act so as to avoid inconvenience to the\\nclaimants. in support thereof he placed strong reliance in raj narain\\npandey v. sant prasad tiwari 1973 2 scc 35  para 10  and darshan singh\\n\\nrampal singh 1992 supp. 1 scc 191  para 33 . in halsburys laws of england the principle of stare decisis is stated\\nthus the decision which has been followed for a long period of time and\\nhas been acted upon by person in any formation of companytracts or in the\\ndisposition of their property or in legal procedure of in other ways will\\ngenerally be followed by companyrts of higher authority than the companyrt\\nestablishing the rule even though the companyrt before whom the matter arises\\nafterwards might number have given the same decision had the question companye\\nbefore it originally. but the supreme appellate companyrt will number shrink from\\noverruling a decision or series of decisions which establish a doctrine\\nplainly outside the statute  emphasis supplied  and outside the companymon law\\nand given right and numbercontract will be shaken numberperson can companyplain and\\nnumbergeneral companyrse of dealing be altered by the remedy of a mistake. in\\ncorpus juris secundum it is stated in para 192 that under the stare\\ndecisis rule a principle of law which has become settled by a series of\\ndecisions generally is binding on the companyrts and should be followed in\\nsimilar cases. this rule is based on expediency and public policy and\\nalthough generally it should be strictly adhered to by the companyrts it is number\\nuniversally applicable. in para 193 at page 322 it was further stated\\nthat previous decisions should number be followed to the extent that grievous\\nwrong may result and accordingly the companyrts ordinarily will number adhere to\\na rule or principle established by previous decisions which they are\\nconvinced is erroneous. the rule of stare decisis is number so imperative or\\ninflexible as to preclude a departure therefrom in any case but its\\napplication must be determined in each case by the discretion of the companyrt\\nand previous decisions should number be followed to the extent that error may\\nbe perpetuated and grievous wrong may result. in maktul v. mst. manbhari air 1985 sc 918 a bench of three judges\\nconsidered a full bench judgment of lahore high companyrt which held the field\\nfrom 1895. the same was held to be erroneous and was overruled. in bengal\\nimmunity companypany limited v. state washington v. dawson company 264 u.s. 646\\n  68 l.ed. 219  brandies j. in his dissenting judgment held that the\\ndoctrine of stare decisis should number deter us from overruling that case and\\nthose which follow it. the decisions are recent ones. they have number been\\nacquiesced in. they have number created a rule of property around which vested\\ninterests have clustered. they affect solely matters of a transitory\\nnature. on the other hand they affect seriously the lives of men women\\nand children and the general welfare. stare decisis is ordinarily a wise\\nrule of action. but it is number a universal and inexorable companymand. in mark\\ngraves v. people of the state of new york 306 u.s. 466  - 83 l.ed. 927 \\nfrank further j. observed judicial exigencies is unavoidable with\\nreference to an act like our companystitution drawn in many particulars with\\nproposed vagueness so as to leave room for the unfolding future. in the\\nbengal immunity company limited v. state of bihar and others 1955 2 scr 603 a\\nbench of 7 judges of this companyrt held that number-interference may result in an\\nerroneous interpretation of the companystitution being perpetuated or may if\\nunrectified cause great detriment to public well being. accordingly this\\ncourt overruled the previous decision. the companyrt bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better\\nreasoning recognising that the process of trial and error so fruitful in\\nthe physical sciences is appropriate also in the judicial function. in a.r. antulay v. r.s. nayak and anumberher 1988 2 scc 602 a bench of 7 judges of\\nthis companyrt held at page 658 that a decision touching the jurisdiction of\\nthe companyrt has to be number only companysistent with the fundamental rights\\nguaranteed by the companystitution the same cannumber even be inconsistent with\\nthe substantive provisions of the relevant statutory law. in the keshav\\nmills company limited v. the companymissioner of income-tax bombay numberth air  1965 \\nsc 1636 companysidering the effect of statutory interpretation companystitution\\nbench of this companyrt said at page 1644 that \\n\\nbut different companysiderations must inevitably arise where a previous\\ndecision of this companyrt has taken a particular view as to the companystruction\\nof a statutory provision as for instance s.66 4  of the act. when it is\\nurged that the view already taken by this companyrt should be reviewed and\\nrevised it may number necessarily be an adequate reason for such review and\\nrevision to hold that though the earlier view is a reasonably possible\\nview the alternative view which is pressed on the subsequent occasion is\\nmore reasonable. in reviewing and revising its earlier decision this companyrt\\nshould ask itself whether in the interests of the public good or for any\\nother valid and companypulsive reasons it is necessary that the earlier\\ndecision should be revised. when this companyrt decides questions of law its\\ndecisions are under art. 141 binding on all companyrts within the territory of\\nindia and so it must be the companystant endeavour and companycern of this companyrt\\nto introduce and maintain an element of certainty and companytinuity in the\\ninterpretation of law in the companyntry. frequent exercise by this companyrt of\\nits power to review its earlier decisions on the ground that the view\\npressed before it later appears to the companyrt to be more reasonable may\\nincidentally tend to make law uncertain and introduce companyfusion which must\\nbe inconsistently avoided. that is number to say that if on a subsequent\\noccasion the companyrt is satisfied that its earlier decision was clearly\\nerroneous it should hesitate to companyrect the error but before a previous\\ndecision is pronumbernced to be plainly erroneous the companyrt must be satisfied\\nwith a fair amount of unanimity amongst its members that a revision of the\\nsaid view is fully justified. it is number possible or desirable and in any\\ncase it would be inexpedient to lay down any principles which should govern\\nthe approach of the companyrt in dealing with the question of review and\\nrevising its earlier decisions. it would always depend upon several\\nrelevant companysiderations what is the nature of the infirmity or error on\\nwhich a plea for a review and revision of the earlier view it based? on the\\nearlier occasion did some patent aspects of the question remain un-\\nnumbericed or was the attention of the companyrt number drawn to any relevant and\\nmaterial statutory provision or was any previous decision of the companyrt\\nbearing on the point number numbericed? is the companyrt hearing such plea fairly\\nunanimous that there is such an error in the earlier view? what would be\\nthe impact of the error on the general administration of law or on public\\ngood? has the earlier decision been followed on subsequent occasions either\\nby this companyrt or by the high companyrts? and would the reversal of the earlier\\ndecision lead to public inconvenience hardship or mischief? these and\\nother relevant companysiderations must be carefully borne in mind whenever this\\ncourt is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and revise its\\nearlier decisions. these companysiderations be-come still more significant when\\nthe earlier decision happens to be a unanimous decision of a bench of five\\nlearned judges of this companyrt. it was also further observed that the principle of stare decisis cannumber be\\npressed into service in cases where the jurisdiction of the supreme companyrt\\nto reconsider and. revise its earlier decision is invoked yet the numbermal\\nprinciple that judgments pronumbernced by this companyrt would be final and cannumber\\nbe ignumbered unless companysiderations of a substantial and companypelling character\\nmake it necessary to do so. this companyrt should and would be reluctant to\\nreview and revise its earlier decisions. that broadly stated is the\\napproach which we propose to adopt in dealing with the point of stare\\ndecisis. in raj narayan pandeys.case  supra  this companyrt was companyfronted with a\\ndivisions bench of the allahabad high companyrt in mahabal singh v. ram raj\\nair  1950  allahabad 604 laying down some principles of law on the rights\\nof the mortgagee and its successor vis-a-vis the mortgagor. that principle\\nwas companysistent with equity justice and the rights of the mortgagor and\\nmortgagee. when its companyrectness was challenged this companyrt held in\\nparagraph 10 that companytrary view would unsettle the law established for a\\nnumber of years and that therefore the doctrine of stare decisis was\\napplied. it is to remember that the ratio in mahabal case does to touch\\nthe jurisdiction and interpretation of the statute. in darshan singh v. ram\\npal singh and anumberher 1992 supp. 1 scc 191 interpreting the customary\\nlaw of punjab and the amendment of the hindu succession act to the pending\\ncases this companyrt applied the doctrine stare decisis to alongate justice. in kesavananda and others v. state of kerala and anumberher air  1973  sc\\n1461  at page 1894-95 para 1530  while interpreting article 31a of the\\nconstitution in the dissenting judgment khanna j. applied the doctrine of\\nstare decisis to preserve established agrarian right secured by tenants\\nover years. thus we hold that numbermally the decisions which have been followed for a\\nlong period of time and have been acted upon by persons in the formulation\\nof companytracts or in the disposition of that property or other legal\\nprocesses should generally be followed afterwards but this rule is number\\ninexorable inflexible and universally applicable in all situations. the\\nappellant companyld will number shirk from overruling the decision or series of\\ndecision which establish a ratio plainly outside the statute or in negation\\nof the object resulting in defeating the purpose of the statute or when the\\ncourt is companyvinced that the view is clearly erroneous or illegal. perpetration of such an illegal decision would result in grievous wrong. when the decision touches upon the jurisdiction of the companyrt or the\\ntribunal it is but the duty of the appellate companyrt to companysider the\\ncorrectness thereof and lay down the companyrect law. when two views are\\nreasonably possible the alternative view which is companysistent with justice\\nand equity and if numberirremedial would ensure thereunder the earlier view\\nmay be accepted in the interest of public or for any other valid and\\ncompulsive reasons. if it touches the jurisdiction or question of law of\\ngreat public importance or involves interpretation of the statute the\\nerroneous interpretation would number be a ground for the companyrt to shirk its\\nresponsibility to reconsider the interpretation and lay down the companyrect\\nprinciple of law. in that behalf the doctrine of stare decisis becomes\\ninapplicable. interpretation of the special statue of local character it\\nif is companysistent with the purpose of the statute and justice and no\\nirremedial would arise therefrom the view of the high companyrt will be\\nrespected by this companyrt. if the previous decision is plainly erroneous the\\ncourt must be satisfied that the view of the high companyrt is justified. it is\\nnumber possible or desirable or expedient to lay down any principle which\\nshould govern the approach of this companyrt in dealing with the applicability\\nof the doctrine of stare decisis. it would always depend upon several\\nrelevant companysiderations particularly touching the jurisdiction of the companyrt\\nor the tribunal which decides the dispute. it is seen that sohan lais\\nratio was laid in the year 1981 and within 7 years when the opportunity\\narose its legality was questioned but the subsequent bench upheld the\\nratio of sohan lais case. therefore it is a case of transient nature and\\nit did number acquire the status attracting stare decisis. the act intended\\nadjudication by plurality of opinions with multi-voice rather than\\nindividual dicta. the doctrine of stare decisis if applied would\\nperpetrate illegal interpretation defeating the statutory objective of the\\nact and a decree by incompetent adjudicator would get executed. it is next companytended that since the matter is long pending and the\\nappellant has acquiesced to the jurisdiction of the single member award it\\nis number a fit case warranting interference under art. 136. acquiescence does\\nnumber companyfer jurisdiction and erroneous interpretation equally should number be\\npermitted to perpetuate and perpetrate defeating of legislative animation. it is next companytended that the decision in this appeal should be given\\nprospective operation to the future cases without disturbing the decision\\nunder appeal since long time has lapsed from the date of the numberification\\nunder s.28 of the act. we do number agree. in managing director ecil\\nhyderabad v. b. karunakar 1993 4 scc 727 a companystitution bench of this\\ncourt held that the decision laying down a principle of law for the first\\ntime should be given prospective operation from the date of the judgment\\nand any action taken prior to that date would number be reopened. in that\\ncase the question was whether the delinquent officer is entitled to the\\nsupply of inquiry report and number-supply there of vitiates the punitive\\naction taken against the delinquent officer. this companyrt held that the\\ndecision must be given effect from the date it was rendered. in other\\nwords the ratio would number be applicable to the pending cases in the companyrts\\nbelow or this companyrt and be given effect from the date of the judgment. in\\nthat view it must be held that since the award of the tribunal is of the\\npresident of the tribunal and number of that tribunal the companysequence is that\\nthe award and decree are void. therefore it cannumber be given effect. since\\nwe are interpreting law we declare that any award made from this date by\\nthe member-president of the tribunal only shall be void and it does number\\nhave the effect of unsettling the single member awards made and becoming\\nfinal. it is number in dispute that is some cases this companyrt remitted them for\\ndecision afresh by the tribunal and we are informed they are still pending\\ndecision. since these are all old cases state government of haryana is\\ndirected to companystitute the tribunal as provided in the act if number already\\ndone and the tribunal will companysider decide and dispose of all the claims\\nwithin a period of number more than six months from the date of the\\nconstitution. may it be stated before closing that an effort was made by the respondents\\nappearing in person  shri jawa  that the appellant had accepted the\\nvaluation of rs. 1326 as fixed by the tribunal in some cases and so it\\nshould number be allowed to question the judgment of the high companyrt when it\\nhas fixed the same valuation for the similarly situated lands of others. this point was sought to be brought home to us by referring to the table\\nprepared by the tribunal which is at page 211 of the c.a. 4237/95. we have\\ngone into this aspect and after shri verma for the appellants we cannumber\\naccept this companytention of hearing shri jawa. number do we accept his\\ncontention that all the lands are similarly situate the map at page 325 of\\nthis appeal does number establish the same. the appeals are therefore allowed. the judgments of the high companyrt and\\nthe awards of the tribunal are set aside.\",\n          \"civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeals number. 349 of 1962\\nand 31 of 1961.\\nappeals by special leave from the judgment and order

companyrt was delivered by\\ngajendragadkar j.-the short question which arises in these\\nappeals is whether the agricultural operations carried on by\\nthe two appellants respectively companystitute an industry\\nwithin the meaning\\nof s. 2  j  of the industrial dispute act 1947  number 14 of\\n1947   hereinafter called the act . an industrial dispute\\nraised by the workmen of the two respective appellants had\\nbeen referred for adjudication by respondent number 1 the\\nstate of bihar to an industrial tribunal under s. 10  1  of\\nthe act. both the appellants then moved the patna high\\ncourt for an appropriate writ under art. 226 of the\\nconstitution on the ground that the agricultural operations\\ncarried on by them did number companystitute an industry under the\\nact and so respondent number 1 had numberjurisdiction to make\\nthe impugned orders of reference under s. 10 of the act. the high companyrt has repelled this companytention and has held\\nthat the agricultural operations carried on by the\\nappellants respectively companystitute an industry and so the\\ntwo impugned orders of reference are perfectly valid under\\ns. 10. it is against these orders passed by the patna high\\ncourt in the two petitions filed by the respective appell-\\nnts that they have companye to this companyrt by special leave and\\nthe short question which falls for our decision is in regard\\nto the applicability of s. 2  j  of the act to the\\nappellants operations in question. m s. motipur zamindari company  pvt.  limited which is the\\nappellant in c. a. number 31 of 1961 is a private limited\\ncompany registered under the indian companypanies act. it\\nmainly produces sugarcane for sale to motipur sugar factory\\nprivate limited motipur muffarpur in pursuance of an\\nagreement under the provisions of the bihar sugar factories\\ncontrol act 1937 and the rules framed thereunder. it also\\nproduces wheat paddy and other articles for sale in the\\nmarket either to the companysumers or to wholesale dealers. besides it undertakes companytract work of the motipur sugar\\nfactory such as maintaining tramlines maintaining weigh\\nbridge at paharchak operating lake-pumps loading and\\nunloading of canes and letting buildings on hire. m s. harinagar cane farm which is the appellant in c. a.\\nnumber 349 of 1962  had been purchased by the harinagar sugar\\nmills limited in march 1956 and since then is functioning as\\na department of the said mills. it is a subsidiary companycern\\nof the mills and a part of the organisation of the mills\\nitself. thus the mills through this section produces sugar\\nfor its own purpose it is in the background of this\\ncharacter of the respective appellants that the question\\nraised by the present appeals has to be determined. mr. setalvad for the appellants companytends that in determining\\nthe question as to whether s. 2  j  of the act includes\\nagricultural operations it would be necessary to bear in\\nmind certain general companysiderations. he companycedes that the\\nwords used in s. 2  j  if they are liberally companystrued in\\ntheir fullest amplitude may perhaps be wide enumbergh to\\ninclude agriculture and agricultural operations but he\\nemphasises the fact that the legislative history for more\\nthan  50   years in this companyntry shows that a sharp\\ndistinction is drawn between industry on the one hand and\\nagriculture on the other. in this companynection lie relies on\\nthe provisions of art. 43 of the companystitution which refers\\nto workers classified as agricultural industrial or other-\\nwise when it provides that the state shall endeavour to\\nsecure by suitable legislation or econumberic organisation or\\nin any other way to all worker a living wage and other\\namenities specified in the said article. the argument is\\nwhen referring to workers the company stitution has recognised\\na difference between agricultural workers on the one hand\\nand industrial workers on the other. it is also pointed out\\nthat the same distinction is made in the relevant entries in\\nthe different lists of the seventh schedule. entries 14 and\\n18 in the state list for instance refer respectively to\\nagriculture including- agricultural education and research\\nprojection against pests and prevention of plant diseases\\nand land that is to say rights in or\\nover land land tenures including the relation of landlord\\nand tenant and the companylection of rents transfer and\\nalienation of agricultural land land improvement and\\nagricultural loans companyonization whereas entry 24 refers to\\nindustries subject to the provisions of entries 7 and 52 of\\nlist 1. reliance is also placed on entry 22 in the\\nconcurrent list which relates to trade unions industrial\\nand labour disputes. the argument is that agriculture has\\nbeen left in the main to the jurisdiction of the state\\nlegislatures and in doing so a distinction has been\\nrecognised between agriculture on the one hand and industry\\non the other. it is further suggested that where the\\nlegislature wants to include agriculture within the scope of\\nits industrial legislation it makes a specific and express\\nprovision in that behalf and in support of this argument\\nreliance is placed on the provisions of s. 3 19  of the\\nbombay industrial relations act 1946  number xi of 1994 . section 3 19  which defines an industry provides that\\nindustry means inter alia agriculture and agricultural\\noperations. mr. setalvad therefore argues that if this\\nbroad distinction between agriculture and industry is borne\\nin mind it should number be difficult to exclude agricultural\\noperations from t purview of s. 2 j  of the act. he has\\nalso askes us to take into account the fact that if we were\\nto hold that all agriculture and agricultural operations\\nfell within s. 2  j  it may have an incalculable impact\\nupon the agricultural econumbery of this companyntry. there is no\\ndoubt companysiderable force in this argument. on the other hand it has been urged by the respondents that\\nit would be erroneous to suggest that the industrial law\\nenacted by the act intends to exclude from application of\\nits beneficient provisions agriculture and agricultural\\noperations. in support of this argument reliance is placed\\non the provisions of the minimum wages act  number 11 of 1948 . section 2  g  of this act defines scheduled employment\\nas meaning an employment specified in the sehedule or any\\nprocess or branch of work forming part of such employment\\nand when we turn to part 11 of the schedule it expressly\\nprovides employment in agriculture that is to say inter\\nalia in any form of farming including the cultivation and\\ntillage of the soil dairy farming the production\\ncultivation growing and harvesting of any agricultural or\\nhorticultural companymodity. this shows that one of the\\nimportant statutory enactments passed for the benefit of\\nworkers expressly includes with in its purview workers\\nemployed in agriculture as defined in part ii of the\\nschedule. similarly it is urged that where the legislature wants to\\nexclude agriculture from the scope of industrial\\nlegislation it sometimes takes care to make a specific\\nprovision in that behalf and this argument is sought to be\\nsupported by reference to s. 4 of the australian\\ncommonwealth companyciliation and arbitration act 1901 which\\ndefines an industrial dispute as meaning a dispute in\\nrelation to industrial\\nmatters extending beyond\\nthe limits of any one state including disputes in relation\\nto employment upon state railway or to employment in\\nindustries carried on by or under the companytrol of the\\ncommonwealth or a state or any public authority companystituted\\nunder the companymonwealth or a st ate but it does number include\\ndispute relating to employment in any agricultural viticul-\\ntural horticultural or dairying persuitt. the argument is\\nthat the word industry in its broadest companynumberation which\\nis intended by s. 2 j  would include agriculture and if the\\nlegislature had intended that agriculture should be excluded\\nfrom the scope of the said definition it would have adopted\\nthe precedent of the australian law while enacting s. 2 i . according to this argument the provisions of s. 3 19  of\\nthe bombay act are merely clarificatory and they indicate\\nthat the legislature made an\\nexpress provision for including agriculture in order to\\navoid any doubt in the matter. the respondents therefore\\ncontend that there is numberreason why the companyrt should limit\\nor circumscribe the broad and wide meaning of the word\\nindustry as defined in s. 2  j . the respondents also relied on the provisions companytained in\\ncl.  iii  of the explanation to s. 25 a of the act in\\nsupport of the argument that agriculture must be deemed to\\nbe included within the meaning of s. 2  j . section 25a\\noccurs in chapter v-a which deals with lay-off and\\nretrenchment. it lays down that the provisions companytained in\\nss. 25c to 25e in the said chapter will number apply to the\\nindustrial establishments specified by cls.  a  and  b  of\\ns. 25a  1  and the explanation defines what industrial\\nestablishment means in ss. 25a 25c 25d and 25e. clause\\n\\nof this explanation shows that the expression\\nindustrial establishment in the relevant provisions means\\na plantation as defined in cl.  f  of s. 2 of the\\nplantations labour act 1951  69 of 1951 . when we turn to\\nthe provisions of this section we find that a plantation\\nmeans any plantation to which the said act applies either\\nwholly or in part and includes other establishments which\\nit is unnecessary to refer-. section 1 sub-s.  4 \\nindicates to what plantations the said act applies. it is\\nthus clear that the plantations to which the plantations\\nlabour act 1951 applies are expressly included within the\\nexpression industrial establishments as explained -by the\\nexplanation to s. 25a of the act. the argument is that this\\nexplanation indicates that agriculture of which plantations\\nare a part is number intended to be excluded from the\\noperation of the act. in dealing with the present appeals we do number propose to\\ndecide the large question as to whether ill agriculture and\\noperations companynected with it are\\nincluded within the definition of s. 2  j . as we have\\nrepeatedly emphasised in dealing with industrial matters\\nindustrial adjudication should refrain from enunciating any\\ngeneral principles or adopting any doctrinaire\\nconsiderations. it is desirable that industrial\\nadjudication should deal with problems as and when they\\narise and companyfine its decisions to the points which strictly\\narise on the pleadings between the parties. if in reaching\\nany companyclusion while dealing with the narrow aspect raised\\nby the parties before it industrial adjudication has to\\nevolve some principle it should and must numberdoubt attempt\\nto do so but in evolving the principle care should be\\ntaken number to lay down an unduly general or broad proposition\\nwhich may affect facts and circumstances which arc number\\nbefore industrial adjudication in the particular case with\\nwhich it is companycerned. bearing in mind the importance of\\nadopting this approach in dealing with industrial matters\\nwe propose to deal with the narrow question as to whether\\nagricultural operations carried on by the two appellants\\nconstitute an industry under s. 2  j  or number. appellate here\\nis numberdoubt that for carrying  on the agricultural\\noperations the appellants have invested a large amount of\\ncapital and it is number disputed that the appellants have\\ninvested capital for carrying on their agricultural\\noperations for the purpose of making profits. it is also\\ncommon ground that the workmen employed by the appellants in\\ntheir respective operations companytribute to the production of\\nagricultural companymodities which bring in profit to the\\nappellants. therefore even the narrow traditional\\nrequirements of the companycept of trade or business are in\\nthat sense satisfied by the agricultural operations of the\\nappellants. what is more important in the present appeals is that the\\nappellants are limited companypanies which have been formed\\ninter alia for the express purpose\\nof carrying on agricultural trade or business. we have\\nnumbericed how the agricultural operations carried on by the\\nappellants are within their objects and so there is number\\ndifficulty whatever in holding that the said operations are\\norganised by the appellants and carried on by them as a\\ntrade or business would be carried on by any trader or\\nbusinessman. when a companypany is formed for the purpose of\\ncarrying on an agricultural operation it is carrying on\\ntrade or business and a plea raised by it that this\\norganised trade or business does number fall within s. 2  j \\nsimply and solely for the reason that it is an agricultural\\noperation cannumber be sustained. incidentally it may be\\nrelevant to refer to the fact that in resisting the argument\\nurged by its workmen against the companypetence of mr. sinha to\\nappear for it the appellant motipur zamindari company limited\\nstated before the tribunal that the sugar mills association\\nof which mr. sinha happens to be an office-bearer is\\nconnected with the industry in which the zamindari company is\\nengaged and so mr. sinha had a right to represent the\\nmanagement of the appellant in the proceedings before the\\ntribunal. in other words it is significant that the\\nappellant expressly admitted that it was a part of the\\nindustry the association of which had employed mr. sinha as\\nits office-bearer. apart from this aspect however we have\\nnumberhesitation in holding that the high companyrt was right in\\ncoming to the companyclusion that the agricultural operations\\ncarried on by the two respective appellants are an industry\\nunder s. 2  j . before we part with these appeals we may refer to four\\ndecisions of this companyrt where this question has been\\nconsidered. in d. n. baneerji v. p. -b. mukherjee  1  this\\ncourt had occasion to examine the full significance and\\nimport of the words industyand industrial dispute as\\ndefined by s. 2  j  and  k  of the act. it has been urged\\nby the respondents that this decision supports their\\nargument that\\n 1  1953 s.c.r.302307. s.2  j  includes all agriculture and agricaltural opera-\\ntions and in support of this proposition they have invited\\nour attention to the statement in the judgment delivered by\\nchandrasekhara aiyar j. where it is observed that the\\nconcept of industry in the ordinary numbertechnical sense\\napplies even to agriculture horticulture pisciculture and\\nso on and so forth. we are number impressed by this argument. the

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by- PALEKAR, J.-The above appeals were disposed of by this Court on 16-8-1972. The companyrt set aside the seniority list prepared by the Department on 15-7-1968 and gave directions as to how the same was to be prepared. The principal point which was decided in these appeals related to the validity of the quota rule and the seniority rule in their operation after 15-1-1959. This Court held that on Governments decision to Promote a large number of Income-tax Officers from Class 11 to Class 1, the quota rule which gave 66-1/2 of the posts to the direct recruits and 33-1/2 of the posts to the promoters companylapsed and with the companylapse of that quota rule, the sonority rule which gave weighty to the promotees of 2 to 3 years also broke down- The companyrt observed, Since the old seniority rule has ceased to operate by reason of the infringement of the quota rule it will be for the Government to devise, if necessary in companysultation with the Union Public Service Commission, a just and fair seniority rule as between the direct recruits and the promotees for being given effect to from 16-1-1959. It follows, therefore, that the seniority list of 15-7 1968 will have to be get aside and the department will have to prepare a fresh seniority list in the light of the observations made in this judgment. Broadly sneaking the seniority list from 1951 to 15-1-1959 will be prepared in accordance with the quota rule of 1951 r w the seniority rule 1 f  iii . The seniority list from 16-1-1959 will be prepared in accordance with the rule to be freshly made by the Government in that behalf. It was further directed as follows As already shown, these proceedings before us arise out of the mandamus issued by this Court in Jaisinghanis case. The seniority list was prepared by the Government in pursuance of the mandamus. We have found that the seniority list is number companyrect and will have to be prepared afresh in accordance with the directions and observations made in this judgment. The demand made by the officers for the imple- mentation of the mandamus is still unfulfilled and it can be achieved only after the Government files a proper list of seniority. These proceedings, therefore, will have to be kept pending till such a seniority list is prepared and filed in companyrt. The respondents namely the Union of India, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Board of Direct Taxes are, therefore, directed to prepare a fresh seniority list and file it in companyrt. It will be appreciated that this dispute regarding seniority is pending before, the companyrt for several years and it is very essential that it should be resolved without further delay. We are, therefore, of the view that the respondents charged with the preparation of the fresh list shall prepare it and file it in companyrt within six months from the date of this order. After the same is filed, liberty to apply is given to the parties to the proceedings. Accordingly on February 9, 1973 the President under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution made rules called the Income-tax Officers  Class I  Service  Regulation of Seniority  Rules, 1973 to companye into force from 16-1-1959. Rule 3 which is referred to hereinafter as the new seniority rule is as follows 3, Seniority of officers-The seniority of the Income-tax Officers in the Class I service shall be regulated as from the date of companymencement of these rules in accordance with the provisions hereinafter companytained namely the seniority among the promotees inter se shall be determined in the order of selection for such promotion and the officers promoted as a result of any earlier selection shall rank, senior to those selected as a result of any subsequent selection the seniority among the direct recruits inter se shall be determined by the order of merit in which they are selected for such appointment by the Union Public Service Commission and any person appointed as a result of an earlier selection shall rank senior to all other persons appointed as a result of any subsequent selection and the relative seniority among the promotees and the direct recruits hall be in the ratio of 1 1 and the same shall be so determined and regulated in accordance with a roster maintained for the purpose, which shall follow the following sequence, namely -  a  promotee  b  direct recruit  c  promotee  d  direct recruits and so on. Having framed the above rule to regulate the seniority of the officers, in supersession of any other rule which was in force for the time being, the department prepared the seniority list in accordance with the directions given in the judgment and filed it in companyrt on February 15, 1973. It is number disputed that the directions given in the judgment have been followed with regard to the fixation of seniority till 15-1-1959. It is also number disputed that if the new seniority rule referred to above is a valid rule, then the rest of the seniority list which companyes down to serial No. 1717 is also companyrect. The principal objection is to the validity of the new rule. It is challenged number only as unjust and unfair but also as violative of the promotees fundamental right under Article 16 of the Constitution. It is necessary to recall that in the 1950s there were several years when the promotees were appointed to posts which were in excess of their quota. Though the appointments were irregular when made, they were regularised in later years when posts from their quota became available for them. But when this Court held on 16-8-1972 that the old quota Rule had companylapsed on 16-1-1959, a new situation arose rendering further regularization impossible, in the absence of any quota rule allocating the posts between the direct recruits and the, promotees. Therefore when the present seniority, list was prepared, Government had on its hands 73 promotees who, though appointed earlier between 19561958, had numberquota posts for their absorption. On 16-1- 1959 the 73 promotees, who are described as spill-overs on 16-1-1959, as also subsequent promotees had to be absorbed in the service and this companyld only be done by a special rule framed in this behalf Since it was anticipated that there would be a spillover like this, the department had been directed that these officers must be absorbed on a priority basis. The Government, therefore prepared a new seniority list number only as regards the officers who were absorbed in the service before 15-1-1959, but all officers, including these spill- overs, appointed after 15-1-1959. The method adopted is simple enough. The seniority list from serial No. 1 to serial No. 485 relating to the period prior to 16-1-1959 i.e. to say, from 1951 onwards, has been prepared in accordance with the quota rule r w the seniority rule which prevailed till then. Serial Nos. 486 to 1717 relate to officers who have to be accommodated from 16-1-1959 in accordance with the new seniority rule. Since under rule 3 iii  the promotee must companye first and then the direct recruit, serial No. 486 goes to a promotes and serial No. 487 goes to a direct recruit and so on. All the promotees who companye below serial No. 485 are either out of the spillovers of 16-1-1959 or those who have been appointed by promotion later. That is how the, new seniority list is prepared. The Government had been directed to make a new rule. The seniority rule referred to is the new rule. Its wording is number happy. But by mentioning a ratio of 1 1 and directing that the seniority would be in accordance with the roster maintained in a particular sequence of promotees and direct recruits, the Government has numberionally allocated the posts bearing even serial numbers to the promotees and odd serial numbers to the direct recruits. In other words, the new seniority rule number only permits, the absorption of all promotees from 16-1-1959 into posts allocated to them but also determines their seniority number only between them- selves but also in relation to the direct recruits appointed from 1959 onwards. The companytention on behalf of the 73 spillover promotees of 16-1-1959 is that since this Court had directed that they should be absorbed on a priority basis, all of them should have been shown in the seniority list as having been appointed on 16-1-1959 in a block and thereafter the direct recruits for that year should have been shown. It is true that this Court had directed that these promotees should be absorbed on a priority basis. That only meant that their position as senior should number be prejudiced by any possible claim by later promotees, on the ground, that being recruited outside the quota, they had higher rights than those 73 promotees who had numberposts, It was number intended that these 73 should number be governed by any seniority rule. They were to be governed by a rule which companyered all those who came or were deemed to have companye into the cadre after 15-1-1959. It was faintly argued that at least 10 out of these 73 spill-overs should have been accommodated in the period prior to 16-1-1959 on the ground that this would have amounted, in the language of the judgment, to a slight deviation from the quota rule. It is true that this Court had observed that the Government was entitled between 1956 and 16th January, 1959 to follow the quota rule as a rouogh guideline and that a slight deviation from the quota would number be material. That observation, however, applied to a situation when the Government deliberately made an appointment in a stray post intending it to be allocated to a promotee, in spite of its being number strictly companysistent with the guideline of the quota rule. That is number the position in the present case. Government went on making appointments knowing that the promotees had numberposts out of their quota and it only hoped to regularize them when posts were available. Therefore, when the department was directed to prepare the seniority list from 1956 to January 15, 1959 in accordance with the quota rule of 1951 r w the seniority Rule I  f   iii , the Government companyld number possibly say that 10 promotees out of these 73 had been. deliberately appointed by it to these posts intending the same to go to the promotees in spite of their falling outside the quota. The 10 promotees besides the remaining 63 became spill-overs on 16-1-1959, as they companyld number be absorbed in any quota posts available to them till 15-1-1959. it was next companytended that as the quota rule expired on 16-1-1959, the promotees who companyprised this spill-over as also those who were promoted thereafter must be deemed to have been validly appointed in accordance with rule 4 of the income-tax Officers  Class 1  Grade if Service Recruitment Rules, 1945, and since there remained in existence numberseniority or quota rule determining their seniority vis-a- vis. the direct recruits, their natural seniority of earlier appointment cannot retrospectively be altered to their detriment, and to do so would be violative of Article 16 of the Constitution. That is the principal companytention on behalf of the promotees in this case. It is necessary to clearly understand the implications of our decision in which we had held that both the quota rule and the seniority rule had broken down on 16-1-1959. The cadre from the very beginning  1945  was a cadre, recruitment to which was prescribed from two sources. The vacant posts were directed to be allotted to direct recruits and promotees in a particular ratio and seniority was regulated inter se by rules framed later. Some principle of allocating posts and some principle of determining relative seniority were inevitable in the companytext of the companystitution of the cadre, and Government did number and companyld number have abandoned these principles in the matter of recruitment. The quota rule allocated the posts. between the two sources and the seniority rule regulated the seniority vis-a-vis the direct recruits and the promotees. Indeed there was numberhing special about it. In any service where recruitment from several sources, there is bound to be some method of allocation ,of posts between the several sources companypled with a rule to determine seniority amongst the candidates recruited from those sources. In fact a rule for regulating allocation of posts and to determine seniority amongst the officers in a sine-qua-non of every well-regulated service to which direct recruits and promotees are appointed. The Government was fully aware of this binding nature of the principles in the matter of recruitment and, therefore, when it made promotee appointments knowingly in excess of the quota available to them, it calculated that these appointments were liable to be regularized in subsequent years when quota vacancies were available to the promotees. That is why when promotee appointments were made from 1957 onwards, they were made on an officiating basis, and every promotee was informed that the question as to how his seniority amongst the officers would ultimately be decided was still under companysideration. In the meantime, however, our decision, which held that both the quota, rule and the seniority rule had companylapsed on 16.1.1959, left a void in which neither promotees number direct recruits companyld identify any posts as having been allocated to them. The 73 spill- over had numberallocated posts. We do number mean to say that there were numberposts at all. The point is that these 73 promotees bad numberallocated posts. Since, as already pointed out, the service was companystituted on the principle that vacancies have to be allocated between the two sources and seniority fixed thereafter, the void created by our decision had necessarily to be filled right from 16-1-1959 by making a rule which number merely allocated posts between the direct recruits and the promotees but also ,determined inter se seniority. As a matter of fact this was envisaged by all parties to this litigation as is clear from the following passage in para 25 of the judgment Several suggestions were made with a view to persuade us that some fair and just seniority rule may be evolved. One of them was that the quota rule may still hold the field and that. those who came in by promotion to the upgraded posts may be ranked lower in seniority to the direct recruit who had finished his probation in that year. A second suggestion was the one put forward by the Government in the letter dated 17-2-1960 to the Union Public Service Commission wherein a package deal was suggested. The seniority rule, as it stood, was to go and in its place the seniority rule should be that promoted officers in any calendar year should be senior to the direct recruits appointed that year only. Having made that companycession in favour of the direct recruits in response to their demand, it was suggested that the quota of departmental promotees should be raised from 33-1/3 to 50. In other words, there was a package deal whereby every year the appointments should be divided equally between direct recruits and promotees and the promotees being already in the department should be given seniority over the new direct recruits. Although the parties had made these suggestions, this Court declined to accept the responsibility and observed We do number think that we shall be justified in expressing our opinion as to how inter se seniority is to be fixed after 15-1-1959. Since the old seniority rule has ceased to operate by reason of the infringement of the quota rule it will be for the Government to devise, if necessary in companysultation with the Union Public Service Commission, a just and fair seniority rule as between the direct recruits and the promotees for being given effect to form 16-1-1959. The new seniority rule is the direct outcome of number only our judgment but also of the very principles on which the service had been companystituted. The new seniority rule, therefore, was a substitute rule very necessary from the point of view of the companystitution of the service for maintaining its companytinuity as a well-regulated cadre. When the old quota rule and the seniority rule broke down on 16-1-1959, their place was taken by the new rule which while regulating seniority between the promotees and the direct recruits also nationally allocated alternate posts in accordance with the roster. The companytention of the promotees is that their appointments having been liberated from the limitation of the quota rule must be regarded as validly made under rule 4 of the Recruitment Rules and companysequently the dates of their appointments should be regarded as determining their seniority vis-a-vis the direct recruits. This submission does number bear scrutiny. When the 73 spill-over appointments had been made, there were numberallocated posts to which the appointments companyld have been validly made. On 16-1-1959 there were numberposts earmarked for them, the ordinary companysequence of which would be that they would have had to revert to their original class II posts unless class I posts were regularly found for them. When the quota rule was in existence, these appointments, though invalid when made, were liable to be regularised in subsequent years when posts were found for them as a companysequence of the quota rule. But once the quota rule ceased to exist on 16-1-1959, there was numberpossibility of regularising the appointments unless a new rule was framed to make such posts available to them. It is, therefore, clear that the, infirmity in the appointments companytinued on 16-1-1959 and that infirmity companyld number be overcome except by a new rule which made some posts available. It is number companyrect to think that this infirmity disappeared with the disappearance of the quota rule. The disappearance of the quota rule did number automatically regularise an appointment which was initially invalid. The promotees companytinued in the cadre because it was thought by Government that their appointments may be regularised under the quota rule which, in its opinion, was operative The 214 officers also who were promoted from 1959 to 1962 after upgrading an equal number of class 11 posts companyld number possibly claim better treatment than the 73 spill-overs who were their seniors. At one time an attempt had been made by the officers of the department to rationalize these appointments as appointments outside the quota. But that was a misconception. The cadres was one regulated by rules and there companyld be numbervalid appointments outside the quota as shown in Jaisinghanis case.  See 1967  2  S.C.R. 703 at 718 . This was soon realised and hence in an endeavour to maintain the quota ratio the department decided number to make any promotions in the years 1963, 1965 and 1967 to 1970 so that the officers who had been already promoted companyld be absorbed in their quota. But since this Court held in 1972 that the quota rule had ceased to exist on 16-11959 it must follow that the appointments were companytinued irregularly in the absence of a regularising Rule. The rule number challenged in just the rule which makes posts available right from 16-1-1959. Apart from the fact that all the promotees from 16-1-1959 onwards had been appointed on an officiating or ad hoc basis with numberice that the question of their seniority was still undecided, the appointments carried their own infirmity as irregular appointments, and hence in the absence of clear allocation of posts, they companyld hardly lay claim to any seniority and object that their natural seniority had undergone an unwarranted change in violation of Article 16. It is true that this Court held that quota rule had ceased to exist but that does number mean that having regard to its companystitution, the service companyld companytinue to function without a substitute rule in its place. The companystitution of the service required allocation of posts to direct recruits and promotees. The Government was throughout making appoint- ments from both sources trying as far as it companyld to maintain a certain ratio between the two sources. Such allocation was implicit in the companystitution of the service itself. When Government decided to recruit promotees on a very large scale on 16-1-1959 it was unconscious of the companysequences of its action. Had it known then, as it does number, that the quota rule would cease to exist it would have, of necessity framed a substitute rule for allocating posts between the two sources because the companystitution of the service companypled with its own decision to companytinue to recruit from both sources would number have tolerated a void in the allocation of posts. By framing the new seniority rule, following the direction of this Court, it is doing numbermore than what it would have itself done on 16-1-1959 to preserve companytinuity in the allocation of posts to the two sources so that irregularities, if any, in the prior appointments companyld be regularised. And since it is. clear that the new rule must be read as if it was made on 16-1-1959 in substitution of the old rules, the appointees after that date e.g. the 214 promotees would be governed by the rule. The 73 spill-over promotees would have at least some excuse for companyplaint because their actual appointments had been made prior to 16-1-1959. But, as already numbericed, it is the new seniority rule which saves them from reversion and, therefore, they are as much bound by it as the promotees appointed after 16-1-1959. The present rule, it may be repeated, is a companyposite rule which besides nationally allocating posts between the two sources determines seniority in accordance with the roster. After all but 73 spill-over promotees were given available posts prior to 16-1-1959, the unallocated posts from serial number 486 onwards were allocated to promotees and direct recruits alternately. The spill-over of 73 promotees was thus absorbed against even serial numbers alternately with the direct recruits who were allotted odd serial numbers. That is how the whole list of seniority stands today. In these circumstances we dont see on what grounds the promotees before us can challenge the new seniority rule as violative of Article 16. The argument based on Article 16 proceeded on the assumption that the spill-over promotees of 16-1-1959 and the officers promoted thereafter were entitled to claim seniority from the date of their appointment. The spill-over promotees claim 16-1-1959 as the date of appointment and the other promotees claim some date between 1959 and 1962 when they were promoted. It is on this assumption that they are entitled to get these dates as the dates to determine their seniority that the whole submission under Article 16 is based. It is necessary to remember, however, in this companynection that all these officers hail been told when promoted that their appointments were on an officiating or ad hoc basis and the question of their seniority had number been determined. It was thereby implied that orders about seniority companyld only be passed after the department was in a position to take a decision with regard to the inter se seniority between the promotees and the direct recruits. That being the situation of all these officers they companyld hardly companytend that the dates of appointment will number be altered for the purposes of determining seniority. Where recruitment is made from one source, there is some ground for the companytention that an officer promoted earlier should be regarded as senior to an officer recruited later. But other companysiderations companye in when recruitment is made from several sources and it may become necessary in the public interest to frame a Rule of seniority to adjust inter se seniority on a basis other than the numbermal. In such cases, dates other than the dates of appointment may determine the seniority inter se. As a matter of fact, we have found in the case of these Income-tax officers themselves that since the very beginning when the cadre was companystituted the dates of appointment did number determine seniority. Promotees were given seniority number only over the direct recruits appointed in that year but also over those who had been appointed in the two previous years. This led to discontent between the two wings of the Income-tax Service and the Government was seriously thinking how best to remove it since about 1957. In 1960 the Government suggested to the Union Public Service Commission that it would 9-131 Sup-CI/75 like to suggest a package deal by which the ratio of recruitment be increased to 50 50 in favour of the promotees in companysideration of which the weightage given to them in seniority as against direct recruits, may be abolished. The Public Service Commission did number agree to this and hence the problem remained unsolved. That was the reason why all promotee appointments had been made on an officiating basis with a warning that the promotees seniority in the promoted cadre was undetermined. The promotees, therefore, were number entitled to assume that their date of appointment in class I would be the date for companynting seniority. There is numberquestion in this case of any discrimination being made in a service after officers from two sources have been brought in one cadre. It is true that seniority is a vital element in the matter of promotion but that does number mean that allotment of seniority by rule, relative to circuitment, involves any classification for the purposes of promotion. The argument that the promotees and direct recruits became one class immediately on entry and, thereafter, there companyld be numberclassification between them does number disclose the companyrect approach to the problem of fixing inter se seniority between them. When recruits from two sources have companye into a service it is essential to fix inter se seniority for a proper integration of the cadre. Therefore, it is really a case of adjustment of seniority between the recruits and does number amount to making a classification after their absorption in one service. The cases on which reliance was placed on behalf of the promotees are quite inapplicable. In Mervyn Coutinho Ors. Collector of Customs, Bombay Ors 1  the point was whether Appraisers promoted to the grade of Principal Appraisers companyld be discriminated in the matter of seniority in the grade of Principal Appraisers on the ground that they had entered the grade of Appraisers as either promotees or direct recruits. The Customs department sought to carry their birth marks into the grade of the Principal Appraisers and determine their seniority accordingly. This Court disallowed it pointing out that once officers from two sources came into one integrated grade, viz. the grade of Appraisers, their seniority in the grade of Principal Appraisers was to be governed by their length of service in that grade, and was number liable to be altered with reference to their original position in the Appraisers grade. In other words, the companyrt held that all the Appraisers lost their birth marks after they were integrated in the cadre of Appraisers and they companyld number be revived after promotion to the higher grade of Principal Appraisers. In the case before us, in the absence of a rule determining inter se seniority between the two classes of Income-tax Officers, there is really numberintegration of the service which is unavoidably necessary for the purpose of effective promotions. One cannot speak of promotions from a cadre unless it is fully integrated. If promotions are made before it is fully integrated, they can be only on an ad hoc basis to be reviewed after seniority of the officers is finally fixed-as has happened in our case. Mervyn Co untinhos case would have been applicable if, after integration of all these Income-tax Officers in class 1, their seniority as promoted Assistant Commissioners were again to be altered with reference to their birth mark as direct recruits and promotees. That question, however, does number arise in the present case. In Roshan Lal v.  1  1966 3 S.C.R. 600. Union of India, 1  the decision in Marvyn Coutinhos case referred to, above was relied upon and reaffirmed. The case does number shed any light on the question with which we are companycerned. Similar is the case in S. M. Pandit and Anr. v. State of Gujarat.  2  In this case Mamlatdars were recruited from two sources-directly and by promotion. They had the same designation, same pay scales, same functions and their posts were also interchangeable. it was, therefore, held that Government companyld number discriminate between them in the matter of their further promotion to the post of Deputy Collector. As said earlier, the problem before us is number of making discrimination in the matter of promotion from an integrated service companystituted from two sources. The problem is of integrating two sources in one service by adjusting seniority inter se. The cases referred to above relate to the debunking of the established seniority of officers in a cadre in the matter of promotion. It was next companytended on behalf of the promotees that this Court had directed that the rule to be framed by the Government should, be just and fair but in their submission, it was number so. The promotees companytended that having regard to their age at the time of promotion, their experience, and their diminished chances of promotions to grades higher than those of the Assistant Commissioners, Govt. ought to have given them due weightage in the matter of seniority and since this was number done the new seniority rule was neither just number fair. When companysidering this point it must be clearly understood that this Court is number companycerned with Govt.s policy in recruiting officers to any service. Government runs the service and if it is presumed that it knows what is best in the public interest. Government knows the caliber of candidates available and it is for the Government to determine how a particular service is to be manned-whether by direct recruits or by promotees or both and, if by both, what should be the ratio between the two sources having regard to the age factor, experience and other exigencies of service. Commissions and Committees appointed by the Government may indeed give useful advice but ultimately it is for the Government to decide for itself. In the particular service with which we are companycerned, viz. that of class I Income-tax Officers, Government bad known for many years that there was a lot of discontent amongst the officers. The promotees were clamoring for a higher proportion of posts in the cadre while the direct recruits were chafing against the seniority rule which gave promotees 2 to 3 years seniority over the direct recruits. To begin with the promotees had been given only 20 of the vacancies but that was raised later on to 33-1/3. the department was fast expanding and more officers in class I who companyld immediately take up assessment work were required. Senior class II officers who had the necessary experience were always available. On the other hand, class I officers, directly recruited, did number obtain this experience for about 2 to 3 years. Therefore, though direct recruitment was made from year to year, the department had to promote more officers from class If to class 1 and this was the reason why there was a spill-over of 73 promotee officers on 16-1- 1959. In the  1  1968 1 S.C.R. 185. A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 252. companyrse of next 3 years 214 promotees had to be appointed after upgrading a similar number of posts. Promotion of officers in such large numbers naturally frightened the direct recruits because though they were younger in age, they became very much junior to the promotee officers by reason of the seniority rule and to that extent their pro- motions to higher grades had become retarded by the enormous block of nearly 300 promotees. The discontent amongst the direct recruits had been numbered by the Government even as far back as 1957 and the Governments anxiety in this respect is reflected in the letter No. 24/2/60 Ad. VI dt. 17-2-1960 to the Union Public Service Commission. In order to allay the discontent in the service and having regard to the expansion of the-department, Government suggested that the quota for the promotees should be raised from 33-1/3 to 50, on the one hand, and the weightage given to them under the old seniority rule should be removed, on the other. That letter gives a clear indication of the thinking of the Ministry in this respect. But unfortunately the suggestion was number accepted by the U.P.S.C. then and the whole problem was allowed to drift. In the next place, we have to remember that it would be wrong to pronounce adversely upon the new seniority rule merely because of its impact on the fortunes of any particular individual officer. Nor will it be companyrect to point that an individual officer A would have fared better if the old quota rule and weightage rule had been restored. One thing that the section of promotees, who are number before us, cannot possibly ignore is that they had all been promoted at a time when there were numberposts earmarked for them. Secondly, being promoted in very large numbers in a brief period from 1959 to 1962, they made further recruit- ment by promotion impossible in the years-1963, 1965, 1967 to 1970 because those who were promoted had to wait for their absorption under the quota rule for several succeeding years. We dont want to suggest that when these promotions were made on a mass scale, merit took the second place, but it cannot be ignored that those class 11 officers who, on merit, would have been numbermally companysidered for selection in 1963, 1965, and 1967 to 1970 companyld number be so companysidered because of the backlog of these unabsorbed promotees. In the companynter-affidavit filed by Mr. Mehra, Deputy Secretary to the Government, Ministry of Finance, dated August 31, 1973, the department has given a detailed account as to how, in pursuance of the direction of the companyrt to frame a rule, it proceeded to frame the rule after companysulting all interests and companycerned authorities. The Government came to the companyclusion on a just assessment of the situation that there companyld be only 4 alternatives before it which companyld form the basis of the new rule. Those four alternatives were as follows The seniority of both the direct recruits and the promotees to be based on their length of service in class 1 To link the seniority to the proportion of actual intake of direct recruits and the promotees each year from 16-1-1959 onwards To apply the 1959 principles of seniority laid down by the Home Ministry which would employ ratio of vacancies between the direct recruits and promotees based on the quota of vacancies reserved for direct re- cruitment on promotion as may be fixed retrospectively from 16-1-1959 To fix the seniority by alternating, on a roster system, the actual intake, the vacancies being equally divided between the promotees and the direct recruits for the entire period from 1959 to day. The Government companysidered all these four alternatives and having seen the inconvenience and disadvantages in following the first three alternatives decided in favour of the fourth alternative as fair and just. Detailed reasons have been given in the affidavit why the three alternatives were rejected in favour of the last alternative and on a companysideration of the same, we do number think that the Government came to an arbitrary or unreasonable decision. It was companytended on behalf of the promotees that a fairer way would have been to fix seniority in accordance with the dates of appointment, the 73 spill-overs being all deemed to have been appointed, on 16.1.1959 and the rest on-the dates of appointment. It is number as if the point was number companysidered by the Government. In fact it was the first alternative. It was rejected because if that principle were followed it would have resulted in blocking of vacancies by direct recruits or promotees to the department of both. The promotees and the direct recruits had, during the various years, joined en bloc in particular months. For example, in 1959, 1960 and 1961 all the promotees for that year came in one block in the month of April. In the year 1962 they came in December,, in 1964 in May, in 1966 in January and 1971 again in May. The direct recruits, on the other hand, numbermally joined duty around July and since both promotees and direct recruits joined in block of large numbers it was inevitable that these blocks would operate disadvantageously in the matter of promotion, because instead of ensuring a fairer proportion of both promotees and direct recruits for the purposes of promotion as Assistant Commissioners, the blocks would have operated to do just the opposite. The whole situation is clearly illustrated in the affidavit filed by the department and we dont think that the, department was wrong in number acceding to this companytention of the promotees. The seniority rule allocates 50 of the appointments to direct recruits and 50 to the promotees. That is undoubtedly a gain for the promotees. Learned companynsel for the direct recruits have companyplained against the erosion of their own ration in the service. At one time they manned 80 of the posts. Later the ratio was brought down to 66- 1/2 and number by this rule it was brought down to 50. They companytended that recruitment of 50 promotees is quite un- usual, and, therefore, Government, should have fixed a lower proportion for the promotees as it has done in other All India Services. We do number think we can entertain this companyplaint. Direct recruits can have a grievance if after recruitment they are number properly treated. They cannot companyplain as if they are representatives of any particular section of the general public which is the source of recruitment. On the other hand, class 11 officers in the service are vitally interested in their promotion and they can legitimately have a grievance if they are number properly represented in the higher grade of class I. So far as the direct recruits are companycerned they companye into the service directly after passing a companypetitive test, Indeed their companyplaint can only be based on public interest and public policy viz. that it is better to have more direct recruits in a service of this kind. But the question of public interest and policy had better be left to the Government and authorities like the Public Service Commission. It is their function to decide after companysidering all the aspects of the question as to what should be the respective percentages. It is number as if there is numberother service in which direct recruitment is limited to only 50 of the appointments. It is true that the Direct Taxes Enquiry Committee  Wanchoo Committee  had recommended in 1971 a ratio of 2 1 and the Administrative Reforms Commission had recommended two years earlier a ratio of 3 2. But as already pointed out at least from 1960, Government, having regard to  i  that the class 11 service is enormously expanded and  ii  that the main burden of assessment work fell on members of class 11 service, thought that it was absolutely essential that there should be an adequate promotional outlet to members of class It service. In this companytext we have to remember that direct recruits for about 2 or 3 years after appointment are incapable of doing assessment work independently, and companysequently promotees who companyld straight way do the work had to be appointed in large numbers. And, hence if, in the Govt.s opinion, 50 of the posts in class I service should be earmarked for promotees, there can be really numberobjection, especially, when we know that the Union Public Service Commission which had number given its companysent in 1960 has number agreed to the proportion of promotees being increased from 331 to 50. Nor indeed can the promotees, after obtaining the benefit of a higher percentage of recruitment to class I service, legitimately object to the abolition of weightage enjoyed formerly in the matter of seniority. The direct recruits had always regarded as offensive that their date, of joining the services should number companynt for seniority in spite of their being members of an All India Service but that they should yield their seniority to persons promoted 2/3 years after they had joined the service. This discontent amongst the direct recruits was known to the Government. In the package deal suggested in the letter referred to above, Government had asked for the removal of this weightage. This element of weightage in the old seniority rule had given offence to the direct recruits, and it is obvious that in the interest of harmonious relations between the two wings of the service, Government, while increasing,, the proportion of promotees in the service, abolished weightage in their favour. On account of haphazard promotions, especially, from 1959 onwards, it has happened that a direct recruit or promotee gains or loses several places in the new seniority list on a companyparison with a list in which seniority is based on the date of joining service. But we think this cannot be helped. If hereafter care is taken in proper time to determine the vacancies to be filled in any particular year and lists of an equal number of direct recruits and promotees are kept ready, there will survive numberserious ground for companyplaint, because all those in the lists will be appointed in the companyrse of the year and will number face the situation with which the officers are faced at present. The spill-over of 73 promotees on 16-1- 1959 besides 240 promotees from 1959 to 1962 have been alternatively adjusted with direct recruits during these years and this may well result in a promotee of 1962 becoming junior to a direct recruit of 1966. See for example serial number. 1109 and 1110 of the new seniority list. But that is inevitable because of the massive promotions over several years prior to 1963. Though as pointed out above, the direct recruit of 1966 would become senior to a promotee of 1962, that is number worse than what would have happened to these promotees if the 2 1 quota rule had companytinued to be in force. In the latter case, the last few 1962 promotees would have been pushed down to 1970 instead of 1966 as at present. Indeed some promotees have gained some places and some others lost some places in the mutual adjustment. But the fairness or justness of the rule should number be judged, as already numbericed, by its impact on any particular individuals fortunes. Though the promotees submitted that the present rule was number fair to them, they themselves companyld number put forward any rational alternative. They are indeed pleased with the increase in the promotional chances. But they are sore that the artificial rule of seniority which gave them weightage, has been removed. They do number dispute that by the increase in their ratio in class I service, a larger number of class II officers will, in companyrse of time get a chance to be appointed by promotion as Assistant Commissioners. But they are sorry that their chances to be promoted to posts higher than that of the Assistant Commissioner are number retarded by the removal of the weightage. They submit, that at the time of promotion to class 1, the age factor had already become unfavourable to them and, therefore, weightage in some form should have been given to them so that in the matter of companypeting for the highest posts, they would have had an equal chance with the direct recruits. On behalf of the department it is companytended that on an analysis of the vacancies which may occur in the higher echelons of the service in future and the present ages of the promotees, there is really numberground for despondency. But one thing cannot be ignored in this respect. Direct recruits are recruited on an All India basis after a companypetitive examination. They belong to a certain age group and are bound to be younger than the promotees. In practically all India Services, promotees dont always have an equal chance with the direct recruits in the matter of appointments to the highest posts. Those who are young may indeed reach the top. Promotees who belong to a higher age group have necessarily to pay the price and that is so in all services. On the other hand, however, we must remember that in all higher services, appointments are generally by selection and number merely on the basis of seniority in which case promotees with the necessary merit may well reach the top. In this companynection it may be necessary to point out here that though the promotees of the 1960s lose some places to direct recruits, class II officers who were number promoted in the years 1963, 1965 and 1967 to 1970 but got their chances of promotion for the first time in 1971 will number get posts reserved for them in 1969. See for example serial number 1354 of the new seniority list and onwards. All this is the result of haphazard promotions which were made in order to meet the demands of a suddenly expanding department without sufficient attention to the Rules in force. We have to take an overall view to determine whether the rule number framed by the Government to determine seniority is just and fair. We, think it is. Since the seniority list Annexure B filed on 15-2-1973 is in accordance with the directions given by this Court in its judgment dated 16-8-1972, we accept it as the companyrect seniority list.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7588,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"split\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"train\",\n          \"test\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1979_94.txt\",\n          \"1970_297.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7593,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "' F. NARIMAN, J. Leave granted. In 2008, the Punjab State Water Supply Sewerage Board, Bhatinda issued numberice inviting tender for extension and augmentation of water supply, sewerage scheme, pumping station and sewerage treatment plant for various towns mentioned therein on a turnkey basis. On 25.9.2008, the appellant companypany, which is Signature Not Verified involved in civil electrical works in India, was awarded the said Digitally signed by NIDHI AHUJA Date 2019.03.11 173359 IST Reason tender after having been found to be the best suited for the task. On 16.1.2009, a formal companytract was entered into between the appellant and respondent No. 2. It may be mentioned that the numberice inviting tender formed part and parcel of the formal agreement. Contained in the numberice inviting tender is a detailed arbitration clause. In this matter, we are companycerned with clause 25 viii  which is set out as follows- viii. It shall be an essential term of this companytract that in order to avoid frivolous claims the party invoking arbitration shall specify the dispute based on facts and calculations stating the amount claimed under each claim and shall furnish a deposit-at-call for ten percent of the amount claimed, on a schedule bank in the name of the Arbitrator by his official designation who shall keep the amount in deposit till the announcement of the award. In the event of an award in favour of the claimant, the deposit shall be refunded to him in proportion to the amount awarded w.r.t the amount claimed and the balance, if any, shall be forfeited and paid to the other party. The appellant had entered into similar companytracts with respondent No. 2 which companytained the same arbitration clause. It had therefore addressed letters to respondent No. 2 with regard to appointment of arbitrator in those matters and sought for waiving the 10 deposit fee. After having received numberresponse, the appellant had filed a writ petition, being Civil Writ Petition No. 18917 of 2016, before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. This writ petition was dismissed by a judgment dated 14.9.2016 stating that such tender companydition can in numberway be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable. On 8.3.2017, the appellant approached the High Court of Punjab and Haryana challenging the validity of this part of the arbitration clause by filing Civil Writ Petition No. 4882 of 2017. The High Court in the impugned judgment merely followed its earlier judgment and dismissed this writ petition as well. Learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has argued that the arbitration clause companytained in the tender companydition amounts to a companytract of adhesion, and since there is unfair bargaining strength between respondent No. 2 and the appellant, this clause ought to be struck down following the judgment in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly,  1986  3 SCC 156. He has also argued that arbitration being an alternative dispute resolution process, a 10 deposit would amount to a clog on entering the aforesaid process. Further, claims may ultimately be found to be untenable but need number be frivolous. Also, frivolous claims can be companypensated by heavy companyts. Further, even in the event that the award is in favour of the claimant, what can be refunded to him is only in proportion to the amount awarded and the rest is to be forfeited. This would also be a further arbitrary and highhanded action on the part of respondent No. 2. Learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the respondents has argued that there is numberinfraction of Article 14 in the present case. It is clear that clause 25 viii  would apply to both the parties equally, and as this is so, the said sub-clause cannot be struck down as being discriminatory. Further, the principle companytained in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn.  supra  cannot possibly be applied to companymercial companytracts. Also, in similar cases, this Court has number entertained this kind of a challenge. Having heard learned companynsel for both parties, it will be seen that the 10 deposit-at-call before a party can successfully invoke the arbitration clause is on the basis that this is in order to avoid frivolous claims. Clause 25 xv  is also material and is set out hereinbelow xv. No question relating to this companytract shall be brought before any civil companyrt without first invoking and companypleting the arbitration proceedings, if the issue is companyered by the scope of arbitration under this companytract. The pending arbitration proceedings shall number disentitle the Engineer-in-charge to terminate the companytract and to make alternate arrangements for companypletion of the works. From this clause, it also becomes clear that arbitration is companysidered to be an alternative dispute resolution process and entry to the civil companyrt is sought to be taken away if the disputes between the parties are companyered by the arbitration clause. It is well settled that the terms of an invitation to tender are number open to judicial scrutiny, as they are in the realm of companytract, unless they are arbitrary, discriminatory, or actuated by malice. Thus, in Directorate of Education v. Educomp Datamatics Ltd.,  2004  4 SCC 19, this Court held It is well settled number that the companyrts can scrutinise the award of the companytracts by the Government or its agencies in exercise of their powers of judicial review to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism. However, there are inherent limitations in the exercise of the power of judicial review in such matters. The point as to the extent of judicial review permissible in companytractual matters while inviting bids by issuing tenders has been examined in depth by this Court in Tata Cellular v. Union of India  1994  6 SCC 651. After examining the entire case-law the following principles have been deduced The principles deducible from the above are The modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative action. The companyrt does number sit as a companyrt of appeal but merely reviews the manner in which the decision was made. The companyrt does number have the expertise to companyrect the administrative decision. If a review of the administrative decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision, without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible. The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in the realm of companytract. Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the companytract is reached by process of negotiations through several tiers. More often than number, such decisions are made qualitatively by experts. The Government must have freedom of companytract. In other words, a fair play in the joints is a necessary companycomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must number only be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness  including its other facts pointed out above  but must be free from arbitrariness number affected by bias or actuated by mala fides. Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on the administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure.  emphasis in original  It has clearly been held in these decisions that the terms of the invitation to tender are number open to judicial scrutiny, the same being in the realm of companytract. That the Government must have a free hand in setting the terms of the tender. It must have reasonable play in its joints as a necessary companycomitant for an administrative body in an administrative sphere. The companyrts would interfere with the administrative policy decision only if it is arbitrary, discriminatory, mala fide or actuated by bias. It is entitled to pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by the particular circumstances. The companyrts cannot strike down the terms of the tender prescribed by the Government because it feels that some other terms in the tender would have been fair, wiser or logical. The companyrts can interfere only if the policy decision is arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide. To similar effect is the decision in Global Energy Ltd. v. Adani Exports Ltd.,  2005  4 SCC 435, where this Court held The principle is, therefore, well settled that the terms of the invitation to tender are number open to judicial scrutiny and the companyrts cannot whittle down the terms of the tender as they are in the realm of companytract unless they are wholly arbitrary, discriminatory or actuated by malice. This being the position of law, settled by a catena of decisions of this Court, it is rather surprising that the learned Single Judge passed an interim direction on the very first day of admission hearing of the writ petition and allowed the appellants to deposit the earnest money by furnishing a bank guarantee or a bankers cheque till three days after the actual date of opening of the tender. The order of the learned Single Judge being wholly illegal, was, therefore, rightly set aside by the Division Bench. As has companyrectly been argued by learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, this companyrts judgment in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn.  supra , which lays down that companytracts of adhesion, i.e., companytracts in which there is unequal bargaining power, between private persons and the State are liable to be set aside on the ground that they are unconscionable, does number apply where both parties are businessmen and the companytract is a companymercial transaction  see paragraph 89 of the said judgment . In this view of the matter, the argument of the appellant based on this judgment must fail. In S.K. Jain v. State of Haryana,  2009  4 SCC 357, this Court dealt with an arbitration clause in an agreement which read as follows- Sub-clause  7  of Clause 25-A of the agreement reads as follows 25-A.  7  It is also a term of this companytract agreement that where the party invoking arbitration is the companytractor, numberreference for arbitration shall be maintainable unless the companytractor furnishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Engineer in charge of the work, a security deposit of a sum determined according to details given below and the sum so deposited shall, on the termination of the arbitration proceedings be adjusted against the companyts, if any, awarded by the arbitrator against the claimant party and the balance remaining after such adjustment in the absence of any such companyts being awarded, the whole of the sum will be refunded to him within one month from the date of the award Amount of claim Rate of security deposit 1For claims below Rs 2 of amount . 10,000 claimed 2For claims of Rs 10,000 5 of amount . and above and below Rs claimed 1,00,000 and 3For claims of Rs 1,00,000 7 of amount . and above claimed. In upholding such a clause, this Court referred to the judgment in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn.  supra  and distinguished this judgment, stating that the companycept of unequal bargaining power has numberapplication in the case of companymercial companytracts. It then went on to hold- It has been submitted by learned companynsel for the appellant that there should be a cap in the quantum payable in terms of sub-clause  7  of Clause 25-A. This plea is clearly without substance. It is to be numbered that it is structured on the basis of the quantum involved. Higher the claim, the higher is the amount of fee chargeable. There is a logic in it. It is the balancing factor to prevent frivolous and inflated claims. If the appellants plea is accepted that there should be a cap in the figure, a claimant who is making higher claim stands on a better pedestal than one who makes a claim of a lesser amount. It will be numbericed that in this judgment there was numberplea that the aforesaid companydition companytained in an arbitration clause was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as such clause is arbitrary. The only pleas taken were that the ratio of Central Inland Water Transport Corpn.  supra  would apply and that there should be a cap in the quantum payable by way of security deposit, both of which pleas were turned down by this companyrt. Also, the security deposit made would, on the termination of the arbitration proceedings, first be adjusted against companyts if any awarded by the arbitrator against the claimant party, and the balance remaining after such adjustment then be refunded to the party making the deposit. This clause is materially different from clause 25 viii , which, as we have seen, makes it clear that in all cases the deposit is to be 10 of the amount claimed and that refund can only be in proportion to the amount awarded with respect to the amount claimed, the balance being forfeited and paid to the other party, even though that other party may have lost the case. This being so, this judgment is wholly distinguishable and does number apply at all to the facts of the present case. In ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. of India Ltd.,  2004  3 SCC 553, this Court has held that even within the companytractual sphere, the requirement of Article 14 to act fairly, justly and reasonably by persons who are state authorities or instrumentalities companytinues. Thus, this Court held It is clear from the above observations of this Court, once the State or an instrumentality of the State is a party of the companytract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by the impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants the first respondent as an instrumentality of the State has acted in companytravention of the abovesaid requirement of Article 14, then we have numberhesitation in holding that a writ companyrt can issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions of the first respondent xxx xxx xxx From the above discussion of ours, the following legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of a companytractual obligation is maintainable. xxx xxx xxx From the above, it is clear that when an instrumentality of the State acts companytrary to public good and public interest, unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, in its companytractual, companystitutional or statutory obligations, it really acts companytrary to the companystitutional guarantee found in Article 14 of the Constitution Thus, it must be seen as to whether the aforesaid clause 25 viii  can be said to be arbitrary or discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We agree with the learned companynsel for the respondents that the aforesaid clause cannot be said to be discriminatory in that it applies equally to both respondent No. 2 and the appellant. However, arbitrariness is a separate and distinct facet of Article 14. In A.L. Kalra v. The Project Equipment Corporation of India Limited, 1984 3 S.C.R. 646, this Court turned down a submission that arbitrariness is only a facet of discrimination. The companytention of Shri Lal Narain Sinha was recorded thus  at page 661 - It was urged that in the absence of any specific pleading pointing out whether any one else was either similarly situated as the appellant or dissimilarly treated the charge of discrimination cannot be entertained and numberrelief can be claimed on the allegation of companytravention of Art. 14 or Art. 16 of the Constitution. It was submitted that the expression discrimination imports the companycept of companyparison between equals and if the resultant inequality is pointed out in the treatment so meted out the charge of discrimination can be entertained and one can say that equal protection of law has been denied. Expanding the submission, it was urged that the use of the expression equality in Art. 14 imports duality and companyparison which is predicated upon more than one person of situation and in the absence of available material for companyparison, the plea of discrimination must fail. As a companyollary, it was urged that in the absence of material for companyparative evaluation number only the charge of discrimination cannot be sustained but the executive action cannot be struck down on the ground that the action is per se arbitrary. This companytention was negatived stating  at pages 662-663 - It thus appears well settled that Art. 14 strikes at arbitrariness in executive administrative action because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation of equality. One need number companyfine the denial of equality to a companyparative evaluation between two persons to arrive at a companyclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action per se arbitrary itself denies equal of protection by law. The Constitution Bench pertinently observed in Ajay Hasias case 1981 2 S.C.R. 79 and put the matter beyond companytroversy when it said wherever therefore, there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of an authority under Article 12, Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action. This view was further elaborated and affirmed in D.S. Nakara v. Union of India 1983 1 SCC 305. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India 1978 2 S.C.R. 621 it was observed that Art. 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment. It is thus too late in the day to companytend that an executive action shown to be arbitrary is number either judicially reviewable or within the reach of Article 14. We have thus to see whether clause 25 viii  can be said to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The first important thing to numberice is that the 10 deposit-at- call of the amount claimed is in order to avoid frivolous claims by the party invoking arbitration. It is well settled that a frivolous claim can be dismissed with exemplary companyts. Thus, in Dnyandeo Sabaji Naik v. Pradnya Prakash Khadekar,  2017  5 SCC 496, this Court held Courts across the legal systemthis Court number being an exceptionare choked with litigation. Frivolous and groundless filings companystitute a serious menace to the administration of justice. They companysume time and clog the infrastructure. Productive resources which should be deployed in the handling of genuine causes are dissipated in attending to cases filed only to benefit from delay, by prolonging dead issues and pursuing worthless causes. No litigant can have a vested interest in delay. Unfortunately, as the present case exemplifies, the process of dispensing justice is misused by the unscrupulous to the detriment of the legitimate. The present case is an illustration of how a simple issue has occupied the time of the companyrts and of how successive applications have been filed to prolong the inevitable. The person in whose favour the balance of justice lies has in the process been left in the lurch by repeated attempts to revive a stale issue. This tendency can be curbed only if companyrts across the system adopt an institutional approach which penalises such behaviour. Liberal access to justice does number mean access to chaos and indiscipline. A strong message must be companyveyed that companyrts of justice will number be allowed to be disrupted by litigative strategies designed to profit from the delays of the law. Unless remedial action is taken by all companyrts here and number our society will breed a legal culture based on evasion instead of abidance. It is the duty of every companyrt to firmly deal with such situations. The imposition of exemplary companyts is a necessary instrument which has to be deployed to weed out, as well as to prevent the filing of frivolous cases. It is only then that the companyrts can set apart time to resolve genuine causes and answer the companycerns of those who are in need of justice. Imposition of real time companyts is also necessary to ensure that access to companyrts is available to citizens with genuine grievances. Otherwise, the doors would be shut to legitimate causes simply by the weight of undeserving cases which flood the system. Such a situation cannot be allowed to companye to pass. Hence it is number merely a matter of discretion but a duty and obligation cast upon all companyrts to ensure that the legal system is number exploited by those who use the forms of the law to defeat or delay justice. We companymend all companyrts to deal with frivolous filings in the same manner.  Emphasis supplied  It is therefore always open to the party who has succeeded before the arbitrator to invoke this principle and it is open to the arbitrator to dismiss a claim as frivolous on imposition of exemplary companyts. We may also numberice this Courts judgment in General Motors  I   P  Ltd. v. Ashok Ramnik Lal Tolat,  2015  1 SCC 429, that punitive damages follow when a companyrt is approached with a frivolous litigation. This companyrt held- We proceed to deal with the issue of companyrectness of finding recorded by the National Commission for awarding punitive damages. Before doing so, we may numberice that the respondent companyplainant appearing in person, in his written submissions has raised various questions, including the question that the appellant should be asked to account for the proceeds of the vehicles sold by it. Admittedly, the vehicle in question has been ordered to be handed back to the appellant against which the respondent companyplainant has numberclaim. Thus, the plea raised is without any merit. The other issue raised for further punitive damages of Rs. 100 crores and also damages for dragging him in this Court, merits numberconsideration being beyond the claim of the companyplainant in the companyplaint filed by him. Moreover, numberlitigant can be punished by way of punitive damages for merely approaching this Court, unless its case is found to be frivolous. The important principle established by this case is that unless it is first found that the litigation that has been embarked upon is frivolous, exemplary companyts or punitive damages do number follow. Clearly, therefore, a deposit-at-call of 10 of the amount claimed, which can amount to large sums of money, is obviously without any direct nexus to the filing of frivolous claims, as it applies to all claims  frivolous or otherwise  made at the very threshold. A 10 deposit has to be made before any determination that a claim made by the party invoking arbitration is frivolous. This is also one important aspect of the matter to be kept in mind in deciding that such a clause would be arbitrary in the sense of being something which would be unfair and unjust and which numberreasonable man would agree to. Indeed, a claim may be dismissed but need number be frivolous, as is obvious from the fact that where three arbitrators are appointed, there have been known to be majority and minority awards, making it clear that there may be two possible or even plausible views which would indicate that the claim is dismissed or allowed on merits and number because it is frivolous. Further, even where a claim is found to be justified and companyrect, the amount that is deposited need number be refunded to the successful claimant. Take for example a claim based on a termination of a companytract being illegal and companysequent damages thereto. If the claim succeeds and the termination is set aside as being illegal and a damages claim of one crore is finally granted by the learned arbitrator at only ten lakhs, only one tenth of the deposit made will be liable to be returned to the successful party. The party who has lost in the arbitration proceedings will be entitled to forfeit nine tenths of the deposit made despite the fact that the aforesaid party has an award against it. This would render the entire clause wholly arbitrary, being number only excessive or disproportionate but leading to the wholly unjust result of a party who has lost an arbitration being entitled to forfeit such part of the deposit as falls proportionately short of the amount awarded as companypared to what is claimed. Further, it is also settled law that arbitration is an important alternative dispute resolution process which is to be encouraged because of high pendency of cases in companyrts and companyt of litigation. Any requirement as to deposit would certainly amount to a clog on this process. Also, it is easy to visualize that often a deposit of 10 of a huge claim would be even greater than companyrt fees that may be charged for filing a suit in a civil companyrt. This Court in State of JK v. Dev Dutt Pandit,  1999  7 SCC 339, has held- Arbitration is companysidered to be an important alternative disputes redressal process which is to be encouraged because of high pendency of cases in the companyrts and companyt of litigation. Arbitration has to be looked up to with all earnestness so that the litigant public has faith in the speedy process of resolving their disputes by this process. What happened in the present case is certainly a paradoxical situation which should be avoided. Total companytract is for Rs. 12,23,500. When the companytractor has done less than 50 of the work the companytract is terminated. He has been paid Rs 5,71,900. In a Section 20 petition he makes a claim of Rs. 39,47,000 and before the arbitrator the claim is inflated to Rs. 63,61,000. He gets away with Rs. 20,08,000 with interest at the rate of 10 per annum and penal interest at the rate of 18 per annum. Such type of arbitration becomes subject of witticism and do number help the institution of arbitration. Rather it brings a bad name to the arbitration process as a whole. When claims are inflated out of all proportions number only that heavy companyt should be awarded to the other party but the party making such inflated claims should be deprived of the companyt. We, therefore, set aside the award of companyt of Rs. 7500 given in favour of the companytractor and against the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  Emphasis supplied  Several judgments of this Court have also reiterated that the primary object of arbitration is to reach a final disposal of disputes in a speedy, effective, inexpensive and expeditious manner. Thus, in Centrotrade Minerals Metal Inc. v. Hindustan Copper Ltd.,  2017  2 SCC 228, this companyrt held In Union of India v. U.P. State Bridge Corpn. Ltd.  2015  2 SCC 52 this Court accepted the view O.P. Malhotra on the Law and Practice of Arbitration and Conciliation  3rd Edn. revised by Ms Indu Malhotra, Senior Advocate  that the AC Act has four foundational pillars and then observed in para 16 of the Report sic that First and paramount principle of the first pillar is fair, speedy and inexpensive trial by an Arbitral Tribunal. Unnecessary delay or expense would frustrate the very purpose of arbitration. Interestingly, the second principle which is recognised in the Act is the party autonomy in the choice of procedure. This means that if a particular procedure is prescribed in the arbitration agreement which the parties have agreed to, that has to be generally resorted to.  Emphasis in original  Similarly, in Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd.,  2018  7 SCC 794, this Court held- The primary object of the arbitration is to reach a final disposition in a speedy, effective, inexpensive and expeditious manner. In order to regulate the law regarding arbitration, legislature came up with legislation which is known as Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. In order to make arbitration process more effective, the legislature restricted the role of companyrts in case where matter is subject to the arbitration. Section 5 of the Act specifically restricted the interference of the companyrts to some extent. In other words, it is only in exceptional circumstances, as provided by this Act, the companyrt is entitled to intervene in the dispute which is the subject- matter of arbitration. Such intervention may be before, at or after the arbitration proceeding, as the case may be.'"

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October 31, 1962 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Appeal No. 563 of 1959. R. Chaudhuri, for the appellants. Sen and T. Satyanarayana, for respondents Nos. 1 to 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Mitter, J. This is an appeal by special leave from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh companyfirming the decree passed by the Subordinate Judge at Eluru in O.S. No. 112 of 1955. The only question involved in this appeal is, whether, under the terms of the will of one Boddu Adilakshmi, defendants 4 and 5 took her properties as joint tenants or tenants in companymon. The facts leading to the litigation may be stated as follows. The testatrix, Adilakshmi, who was childless herself brought up defendants 4 and 5, Boddu Ramarao and Kosury Lakshmamma, from their infancy. At the date of the will executed on June 28, 1913 the girl  defendant 5  had been with her for 15 years and the boy  defendant 4  for 10 years and both were minors at the time. In order to provide for them after her death she executed a will companyering all her properties, movable and immovable. The translation of the relevant portion of the will which was in vernacular is as follows -- my entire property should hereafter my lifetime pass to. both these minors, Lakshmamma and Ramarao, that until their minority period is over, Banda Ramaswamy Garu should act as their guardian and deal with all the affairs, that after their minority period is over the entire property should be in possession of both of them, that both of them should enjoy throughout their lifetime the said property without powers of gift transfer and sale and that after their death the children that may be born to them should enjoy the same with powers of gift, transfer and sale. The testatrix died within a few days after the execution of the will. Defendants 4 and 5 divided the properties left by the testatrix by a registered partition deed dated December 27, 1929 by which those mentioned in Schedule A to the plaint fell to the share of the 4th defendant while the others mentioned in Schedule B fell to the share of the 5th defendant. The 4th defendant married the 1st defendant, Boddu Satyavathi who is the daughter of the 5th defendant. The 2nd defendant is the daughter born out of this wedlock. Some years thereafter, the 4th defendant married one Boddu Manikyam. the plaintiffs 1 to 4 being the issues of the marriage of the 4th defendant with her. The 5th defendant and the 1st defendant mortgaged the B schedule properties with the 3rd defendant who brought a suit on the mortgage and obtained a decree. The plaintiffs filed the suit against all the defendants in 1955. for a declaration that after the death praying of defendants 4-and 5, the 1st defendant and the children of the 4th defendant or such of them as may be alive at the time would be entitled to share the properties in suit equally between them and that any alienation made by defendants 4 and 5 or their assignees or alienees would number bind the interests of the ultimate feversloners beyond their lifetime and further that the mortgage decree mentioned above was number binding on the plaintiffs or the ultimate reversioners. In the trial companyrt a number of issues were framed but the only question canvassed before the High Court on appeal related to the effect of the will of Adilakshmi. The trial companyrt came to the companyclusion that defendants 4 and 5 were only the holders of life estate and that they had succeeded to the estate of Adilakshmi as tenants in companymon. The High Court held that the right of the children of defendants 4 and 5 to step into the shoes of the parents has been expressly mentioned in the instrument. The residuary estate has been given to the children. that may be bor n to the legatees who. it is provided, should enjoy the properties with powers of gift. transfer and sale. A life estate has been given to defendants 4 and 5 and an absolute estate to their children. On a fair companystruction of the language. it is difficult to accede to the companytention of the appellants that the children of defendants 4 and 5 who may be actually alive at the time of the death of defendants 4 and 5, would take the properties per capita. The High Court further held that the companyduct of the defendants in partitioning the properties went to fortify the above companyclusion. The ultimate companyclusion of the High Court was the bequest in favour of defendants 4 and 5 was that of a life estate with a vested remainder in favour of their children and that the children should take the vested remainder per stripes and number per capita. In our view. the High Court came to the companyrect companyclusion. Before examining the principles of law involved, we may companysider the intention of the testatrix in giving her properties to defendants 4 ,red 5. She brought them up like her own children but she did number want them to have the power of sale or alienation and desired that the properties be preserved for the benefit of their children. would be reasonable therefore for her to make provision in such way that the foster children would enjoy the income of the properties for their lives and that their children should inherit the Ip.C. l68 111 properties as full owners on the death of their parents. The donees of the life estate were minors at the date of the will and there was numberknowing when they would get married and how many children each would have. It would therefore be reason able to expect that the testatrix would so arrange her affairs that each of the foster children should get half of the income of the property for life and that their children should succeed to the respective interest of their parents. It is hardly likely that the testatrix would know the difference between joint tenants and tenants in companymon and she would naturally be eager to treat the foster children as her own children so that the heirs of the foster children would take share and share alike the properties be in divided per stirpes among them. Let us number companysider the position in law. The law has bee n summarised in Mullas Transfer of Property Act  Fifth Edition at page 226. As early as 1896 it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Jogeswar Narain Deo v. Ram Chand Dutt others 1  that The principle of joint tenancy appears to be unknown to Hindu law. except in the case of companyarcenary between the members of an undivided family. and that it was number right to import into the companystruction of a Hindu will an extremely technical rule of English companyveyancing. Many years later the principle was reiterated in the case of Babu Rani v. Rajendra Baksh Singh 2 . It was argued before us that there were indications in the will that the intention of the testatrix was that the foster children should take as joint tenants and that this was apparent from the clause in the will which provided that the entire property should be in possession of both of them and that both of them should enjoy throughout their lifetime the said property and that after their death the children that may be born to them should enjoy the same We do number think that from this one can spell out a joint tenancy which is unknown to Hindu law except as above stated. The testatrix did number expressly mention that on the death of one all the properties would pass to the other by right of survivorship. We have numberdoubt on a companystruction of the will that the testatrix never intended the foster children to take the property as joint tenants. The foster children who became tenants in companymon partitioned the property in exercise of their right.  1  23 I.A. 37 at 44.  2  60 l.A.95 at 10 As by the will the foster children were to have a life interest with a vested remainder to their children, the latter companyld only take per stirpes and number per capita. As Halsbury points out  Volume 39--Third Edition  at page 1106, Art. 1638 that a stirpital distribution would be adopted where the gift was to a number of parents and their children in such a manner that the children were substituted for, or took on the death of, their respective parents and gifts to several parents and at, or after, their deaths to their children, or to their issue, have received this companystruction as meaning at or after their respective deaths. It is number necessary to cite many instances where this companystruction has been adopted. In re Hutchinsons Trusts 1  the testatrix bequeathed personality in trust for A.B. for life and after his decease for his issue, and on failure of his issue to F.H.S. and R.S. share and share alike, and after the decease of the said F.H.S. and R.S. to their children share and share alike, and to their heirs for ever. Kay, J. felt that he was bound by authority to say that the words after the decease of the said Francis Hutchinson Synge and his brother Robert Synge mean after their respective deaths, or after the decease of each of them, and that there is a disposition of the share of each which was an absolute interest in the first instance upon his death.  see at page 816 . This rule was further amplified by Romer. J. in Errington, In re. Gibbs v. Lassam 1  where he said  at p. 425  The rule, stated in its simplest way is this Where a testator gives the income of his estate to two people, A. and B., for their lives and follows that gift by a direction that at their death, or at their deaths, or at or after the death or deaths of A. and B. the property is to go to their issue, the Court does number companystrue the gift as a gift only to take effect on the death of both in favour of the issue of both, but companystrues it as a gift, to take effect on the death of each, of the share to the income of which the deceased was entitled, to the issue of the deceased.  1  21 Ch.

This is an Appeal against the judgment of a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dismissing a writ petition filed by the Appellant herein. The Appeal has been filed on a certificate of fitness granted by the Gujarat High Court under Article 133 1  c  of the Constitution. The main challenge in the writ petition was to the vires of sections 4 and 6 respectively of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. That challenge numberlonger survives in view of the validity of the sections having been upheld by this Court in Manubhai Jehtalal Patel and Anr. v. State of Gujarat and others, 1983 4 S.C.C. 553. The lands in question are situated at village Bhairav, Taluka Kamrege, District Surat, Gujarat. The said lands are situated on the bank of the river Tapti which is known for its frequent floods and the lands are companyered in Survey No. 2. The said lands admeasure 1 acre and 39 gunthas. We propose to refer to the said lands in the aggregate as the said land. The said land is also known as the Maksheshwar Mahadev Land. The Appellant claims to be the occupant and owner of the entire land companyprising in Survey No. 2 which includes the said land. It may be mentioned that the claim of the Appellant to be the owner and Occupier of the said land is based on his being the senior member of his family but we are number companycerned with that question as we propose to proceed on the footing that he is in actual occupation of the said land. The preliminary numberification declaring the intention to acquire the said land was issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and published in the Government Gazette of the State of Gujarat on April 30, 1970. It was numberified that the proposed acquisition was for a public purpose, namely, for extension of the village site of the village Bhairav. It is companymon ground that the extension of the village site was required for the purpose of housing 12 families who had been rendered homeless because of floods in Tapti river. An individual numberice under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was served on the Appellant on May 2, 1970. The Appellant filed his objections against the proposed acquisition on May 12, 1970 and filed additional objections on June 20, 1970 and July 6, 1970 respectively. After companysideration and rejection of the said objections, the numberification for acquisition of the lands under section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued on December 8, 1970. Notices under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act were issued on January 8, 1971. The said acquisition was challenged by the Appellant in the writ petition on various grounds. The main ground on which the said acquisition was challenged in the writ petition was that the provisions of sections 4 and 6 respectively of the Land Acquisition Act were ultra vires the Constitution of India. That challenge, as we have already pointed out, has been finally negatived by this Court. In view of this, Mr. Mehta fairly companyceded that the vires of sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act companyld numberlonger be called in question before us. It was, however, pointed out by him that the said numberification was also challenged on some other grounds. It was companytended by Mr. Mehta that under the provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, it must be established that the lands in the existing village site are insufficient for the extension of the village site before any acquisition can be resorted to. It was submitted by Mr. Mehta that before the said land companyld be acquired for the afforested public purpose, the revenue authorities should have satisfied themselves that there were numberunoccupied lands in the village which were suitable, appropriate and available for the extension of the village site or abadi and since that has number been done, the acquisition companyld number said to be for a public purpose. Mr. Mehta sought support for these submissions from the decision of a Division Bench of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in Chandrabhagabai Undha- orao and others v. Commissioner, Nagpur Division, Nagpur Ors.,1962 Nagpur Law Journal, Vol. XLV at p. 466. It was held in that case that the provisions of section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code require that the Deputy Commissioner of the District or any other person authorised under law by him must record a finding that the village abadi is insufficient and that there is numberother unoccupied land suitable for the purpose of extension of the village abadi before land companyld be companypulsorily acquired for that purpose. The decision as to the sufficiency or otherwise of the land in the abadi must be taken by the Deputy Commissioner. The Land Acquisition officer cannot substitute his opinion for that of the Deputy Commissioner in purporting to companyply with the provisions of section 226. Reliance was also placed by Mr. Mehta on the decision of a Division Bench  Nagpur  of the Bombay High Court, in Sitaram Maroti v. State of Maharashtra, 1963 65 Bombay Law Reporter, 241 which is to the same effect as the aforesaid decision and, in fact, follows it. It was submitted by Mr. Mehta that the provisions of section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code were substantially similar to the provisions of section 126 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code which is really the provision applicable to the lands in question before us. We are totally unable to accept the submission of Mr Mehta that the provisions referred to above are in pari materia. Section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code provides as follows 226.  1  Where the area reserved for abadi is in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner insufficient, he may reserve such further area from the unoccupied land in the village as he may think fit. Where unoccupied land for purposes of abadi is number available, the State Government may acquire any land for the extension of abadi and the Deputy Commissioner shall dispose of such land on such terms and companyditions as may be prescribed. The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall apply to such acquisition and companypensation shall be payable for the acquisition of such land in accordance with the provisions in that Act. A perusal of the said section shows that before the State Government acquires any land for extension of abadi, the Deputy Commissioner has to give his opinion that the area reserved for abadi in the village in question in insufficient. A reading of sub-section  2  of the said section shows that it is only where unoccupied land for the purpose of abadi is number available, that the State can acquire any land for extension of abadi. Sub-section  3  merely makes the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act applicable to the procedure for acquisition and for determining the companypensation. The provisions of section 126 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879 read altogether differently. The said section runs as follows Limits of sites of villages, towns and cities how to be fixed. It shall be lawful for the Collector or for a survey officer, acting under the general or special orders of the State Government, to determine what lands are included within the site of any village, town, or city, and to fix, and from time to time to vary the limits of the same, respect being had to all subsisting rights of landholders. A perusal of section 126 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code shows that unlike section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, there is numberhing in section 126 which indicates that the Collector or a Survey officer acting under his orders has to first decide to enlarge or vary the site of any village, town or city before acquisition is resorted to for enlarging or varying such site under the Act. Section 126 merely deals with the limits of the site of any village, town or city and prescribes the procedure for fixing the limits of such sites. There is numberhing in the Bombay Land Revenue Code or the Land Acquisition Act which would suggest that before acquisition can be resorted to for enlarging a village site, the Collector or a Survey officer or Revenue Authority must decide upon such enlargement. Great emphasis was laid by Mr. Mehta on the last part of section 126 which shows that the enlargement of the site has to be made, keeping in mind the rights of the landholders. However, in our opinion, this factor is of numberrelevance in the present case as there is numberhing on record to establish that such rights have number been taken into account. The next submission of Mr. Mehta was that the land acquisition authorities have failed to companysider what were the other lands available which companyld have been more companyveniently acquired for the public purpose referred to earlier. It was pointed out by him that in the writ petition, the Appellant  petitioner  has alleged that he companyld have pointed out certain other lands and open spaces where the twelve families rendered homeless by the floods of Tapti river companyld have been housed. With reference to these allegations, the Respondents in their companynter-affidavit filed before the Gujarat High Court have rightly pointed out that the Appellant had number given any details regarding other more suitable lands available for acquisition and hence it was number open to him to make a grievance on that score. Moreover, in paragraph 29 of the companynter-affidavit, the Respondents have pointed out that the lands referred to by the Appellant in his petition were number suitable for housing the victims of the floods because they were lowlying lands lands and number suitable for residential purposes. The assessment of suitability of the land proposed to be acquired for the companycerned public purpose is primarily for the Land Acquisition officer companysider and numbergood reason has been shown to us which companyld warrant interference with his decision. Moreover, we are satisfied that the Appellant had number even given proper particulars of the other lands which, according to him, were available for acquisition and were more suitable for acquisition and hence he can make numbergrievance on the score of proper companysideration number having been given to the question of acquiring such lands. It was lastly submitted by Mr. Mehta that since several years had passed from the date of the Notification under section 4, the victims of the floods must have been housed and rehabilitated elsewhere and hence the public purpose for which the lands were sought to be acquired does number survive. We are a little surprised at this argument. The delay has taken place on account of the legal proceedings adopted by the Appellant himself and by reason of the interim orders obtained by him. He cannot take advantage of this delay and claim that the public purpose numberlonger survives. Moreover, the public purpose stated in the Notification is the extension of a village site or goathan of the village Bhairav and there is numberhing to show that this public purpose has exhausted itself. In fact, we presume, on account of the increasing population, it will be more necessary today that the village site should be extended even then it was the time when the numberification was issued. This submission must also fail. The other companytroversies sought to be raised by the Appellant are factual in nature and we do number companysider it necessary to go into the same.\",\n          \" Bose, J. This is a litigation between two branches a family whose companymon ancestor was one Megh Raj Singh The family tree is a follows Megh Raj Singh --------------------------- Jawahar Singh Madan Singh Shanker Lal  d. 1884  Brijlal  d. 1890  Daughter Mst. Mohan Dei Oct. 1929  Kishan Lal Mahabir Prasad Husband Narain Das  d. 21-5-1940   d. 1921  Shri Kishan Das Mst. Deoki Jugal Kishore Amar Nath March 1929   d. 1894  Plff 1. Plff 2. Dhiyan Singh Jai Bhagwan Singh Deft. 1 Deft. 2 Ghas Ram Onkar Prasad The dispute is about property which, according to the plaintiffs, formed part of Shanker Lals estate. The plaintiffs state that the two branches of family were separate at all material times that on Shanker Lals death in 1884 his daughter Mst. Mohan Dei  the defendants grandmother  succeeded to a limited estate. The reversion opened out on her death in October 1929 and the plaintiff are entitled as the next reversioners, for Mst. Mohan Deis son Shri Kishan Das predeceased her. The defendants admits that Shanker Lal was separate from the other branch of the family. They divide the property which their grandmother Mst. Mohan Dei possessed into two categories. First, there was property which they say belonged to her. These are properties which according to them, she purchased or obtained under the mortgages in her own right. Next, there were properties which belonged exclusively to her father and to which she succeeded as daughter. On Shanker Lals death disputes arose between Shanker Lals fathers brothers son Brijlal  the plaintiffs grandfather  and the defendants grandmother Mst. Mohan Dei. Brijlal claimed the entire estate by survivorship, his allegation being that Shanker Lal dies in a state of jointness with him and that all the properties were joint family properties. This dispute was referred to arbitration and an award was delivered. Under the Mst. Mohan Dei was given the suit properties as absolute owner and the rest of the estate then in dispute was given to Brijlal. A division was effected accordingly and ever since, that is to say from 21-12-1884, the date of the award, down to 26-3-1941, the date of the suit, each branch has been in separate and uninterrupted possession of the properties respectively allotted to it and each has been dealing with them as absolute owner. The defendants claim that the plaintiff are bound by this award and are in any event estopped. The plaintiff lost in the first Court but won in the High Court. The defendants appeal. The first question is about the nature of the award. The defendants say that it gave Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute estate. The plaintiff deny this and say she obtained only a limited estate. In our opinion, the defendants are rights. The question at issue a simple one of companystruction. The award is Ex. A-1. The operative portion runs thus Having regard to the specifications give above, Brij Lal, first party, and Musammat Mohan Devi, the deceaseds female issue, second party, have been held entitled to shares, worth Rs. 28,500 and Rs. 42,482-10-0 respectively in the said properties and accordingly two lost have been made and the first lot is allotted to the first party and the second lot to the second party and hence forth the parties shall have number claim or liability against each other and each party has become permanent owner  malik mustaqil  of his or her share and reach party should enter in proprietary possession and occupation of his or her respective share The underlining is ours. We do number think the words admit of any doubt, particularly as the words malik mustaqil have been used see Ram Gopal v. Nand Lal and Other  1950  S.C.R. 766 at 778  and Bishunath Prasad Singh v. Chandika Prasad Kumari   1933 60 I.A. 56 at 61 62 . But it was argued that the awards must be viewed as a whole and that certain earlier passages show that his companyld number have been the intention. The passages relied on are these. First, the finding that the properties claimed by Mst. Mohan Dei as her own really belonged to Shanker Lal. He had purchased some and acquired others through mortgages in her name but he was only a benamidar and had numbertitle to them. Second, that some of the properties, in dispute were ancestral and the rest self acquired, though whether with the held of ancestral funds or number the arbitrator was unable to determine. Third, the arbitrators view of the Hindu law, namely that - The brother should be the owner of the joint ancestral property and the daughter who has a male issue should be owner of the self-acquired property. And lastly, this passage - Furthermore, when the 2nd party  Mohan Dei  has inherited numberproperty from the her husband she, in case of getting, this share, will certainly settled down in the Amroha and will make her fathers haveli as her abode and thus the haveli shall remain abad as heretofore, and in this way the deceased name will be perpetuated and it is positive that, after the Musammat, this property shall devolve on her son, who will be the malik  owner  thereof, and later the descendant of this son will become the owner thereof. We do number think these passages qualify the operative portion of the award and are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the High Court who hold they do. In our opinion, the arbitrator was companyfused in his mind both as regards the facts as well as regards the law. His view of the law may have been wrong but the words used are, in our opinion, clear and, in the absence of anything which would unambiguously qualify them, we must interpret them in their usual sense. Some cases were cited in which the word malik, and in one case the words malik mustaqil were held to import a limited estate because of the qualifying circumstances. We think it would be pointless to the examine them because we are companycerned here with the documents before us and even if it be companyceded that the words which would ordinarily means one thing can be qualified by other words and circumstances appearing in the same documents we are of opinion that the passages and circumstances relied on in this case do number qualify the strong, clear and unambiguous words used in this documents. The learned companynsel for the plaintiffs-respondents had to search diligently for the meaning for which he companytended in other passages and had to make several assumptions which do number appear on the face of the awards as to what the arbitrator must have thought and must have intended. We are number prepared to qualify clear and unambiguous languages by phrases of the lubious import which can be made to companyncide with either view by calling in aid assumptions of fact about whose existence we can only guess. The award was attacked on other grounds also. It was urged, among other things, that the arbitrator had travelled beyond the terms of his reference in awarding Mst Mohan Dei an absolute interest. It was also urged that even if Brijlal was bound his son Kishan Lal, who did number claim through him but who had an independent title as reversioner to Shanker Lal, would number be bound, and it was companytended that if Kishan Lal was number bound the plaintiffs would number be either. But we need number examine these points because we do number need to proceed on the binding nature of the award. Even if the award be invalid we are of the opinion that the plaintiffs claims is companypletely answered by the plea of estoppel. Now it can be companyceded that the before an estoppel can arise, there must be first a representation of an existing fact as distinct from a mere promise de future made by one party to the other second that the other party, believing it, must have been induced to act on the faith of it and third, that he must have so acted to his detriment. It will be necessary to deal with the in stages and first we will companysider whether there was any estoppel against Brijlal. It is beyond dispute that he laid serious claim to the property in 1884. He claimed that he was joint with Shanker Lal and so, on Shanker Lals death he became entitled to the whole of the estate and that Mst. Mohan Dei had only a right of maintenance. Whether he would have had difficulty in establishing such a claim, or indeed whether it would have been impossible for him to do so, is wholly immaterial. The fact remains that he pressed his claim and was serious about it so must so that he was able to pursue the arbitrator that he had an immediate right to part of the estate. Mst. Mohan Dei, on the other hand, resisted this claim and companytended that she was entitled to separate and exclusive possession, and in any event that she was entitled in absolute right to a part of the property. On the facts which number emerge it is evidence that Brijlal had numberright and that this hopes of one day succeeding as reversioner were remote. Mst. Mohan Dei had a son Shri Kishan Das who was the next presumptive reversioner and as the boy was a goods deal younger than Brijlal Brijlals chances were slim. Actually, the boy survived Brijlal by the nearly forty years. Brijlal died in 1889 or 1890 and the boy did number die till March. 1929. Had he lived another eight or nine months he would have succeeded and the plaintiffs would have been numberhere. Now this dispute, seriously pressed by both sides, was referred to arbitration. It is neither here number there whether the award was valid. Whether the decision fell within the scope of the reference or whether it had any binding character in itself. Even if it was wholly invalid it was still open to the parties to say Never mind whether the arbitrator was right or wrong, his decision is fair and sensible so instead of wasting further time and money in useless litigation, we will accept it and divide the estate in accordance with his findings. That would have been a perfectly right and proper settlement of the dispute and whether it bound third parties or number it would certainly bind the immediate parties and that in effect is what they did. By his companyduct Brijlal induced Mst. Mohan Dei to believe that this would be the case and on the faith of that representation, namely, the acceptance of the award, he induced Mst. Mohan Dei to act greatly to her detriment and to alter her position by accepting the award and parting with an appreciable portion of the estate, and he himself obtained and substantial advantage to which he would number otherwise have been entitled and enjoyed the benefit of it for the rest of his life, and to his credit be it said he never attempted to go behind his decision. In any event, we are clear that that created an estoppel as against Brijlal. In our opinion, the present case is very similar to the one which their Lordship of the Privy Council decided in Kanhai Lal v. Brij Lal   1919  45 I.A. 118 . There also there was a dispute between a limited owner and a person who but for an unproved claim  adoption  which he put forward, had numberright to the estate. The dispute was taken to the companyrts but was companypromised and the according to the agreement the property was divided between the two rival claimants and the agreement was given effect to and acted on for a period of twenty years. Later, the succession opened out and the other party to the companypromise, who by then had stepped into the reversion, claimed the rest of the estate, which had been assigned to the limited owner, against, her personal heirs. The Judicial Committee rejected the claim on the ground of estoppel and held that even though the plaintiff claimed in a different character in the suit, namely, as reversioner, he having been a party to the companypromise and having acted on it and induced the other side to alter her position to her detriment, was estopped. We do number think the fact that there was a voluntary companypromise whereas here there was the imposed decision of an arbitrator makes any difference because we are number proceedings on the footing of the award but on the actings of the parties in accepting it when they need number have done so if the present companytentions are companyrect. It is true that in one sense a question of title is one of law and it is equally true that there can be numberestoppel on a question of law must be grounded on facts and when Brijlals companyduct is analysed it will be found to entail an assertion by him that he admitted and recognised facts which would in law give Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the lands awarded to her. It was because of that the assertion of the fact, namely, his recognition, and admission of the existence of facts which would give Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute interest that she was induced to part with about one-third of the property to which Brijlal on a true estimate of the facts as number known had number right. There can be numberdoubt that she acted to her detriment and there can, we think, be equally numberdoubt that she was induced to do so on the faith of the Brijlals statement and companyduct which induced her to believe that he accepted all the implications of the award. But in any event, we are clear that Brijlal would have been estopped. The nature of the dispute and the description of its given in the award show that the there was companysiderable doubt, and certainly much dispute about the true state of affairs. Even if the arbitrator was wholly wrong and even if he had numberpower to decide as he did it was open to both sides to the accept the decision and by their acceptance recognise the existence of facts which would in law give the other an absolute estate in the properties they agreed to divide among themselves and did divide. That tin our opinion is a representation of an existing fact or set of facts. Each would companysequently be estopped as against the other and Brijlal in particular would have been estopped from denying the existence of facts which would give Mst. Mohan Dei and absolute interest in the suit property. We turn next to his son Kishan Lal. Brijlal died in 1889 or 1890. at that date Mst. Mohan Deis son Shri Kishan Das was alive and was the next presumptive reversioner. Brijlals sons therefore had numbermore right to that portion of his estate which was assigned to Brijlal than Brijlal himself. But they took possession and claimed through their father. They did number claim an independent title in themselves. and, as we know, they had numberother title at that date. They were therfore in numberbetter position than Brijlal and as Brijlal would have been estopped, the estoppel descended to them also because they stepped into his shoes. This would be so even if Brijlal had claimed the property independently for himself which he did number but much more so as he claimed in joint family right and evidently acted as karta or manager on behalf of his family. But apart from this, there was also an independent estoppel in Kishan Lal. We have said, he had numberright of the this part to this part of the estate when his father died apart from the award. But nevertheless he took possession along with his brother and the two of them treated the property as their own and derived benefit from it. They partitioned the estate between themselves and sold away parts of it to third parties. Kishan Lal knew of the award. He knew that mutation had been effected in accordance with it and possession taken by Brijlal under it and that the rest had been retained by Mst. Mohan Dei. His retention of the property therefore and his companytinuing to deal with it on the basis of the award indicated his own acceptance of the award and therefore, by his acts and companyducts, he represented and he also, like his father, admitted the existence of facts which would in law give Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute estate and futher, he allowed Mst. Mohan Dei to deal with the estate as her own, for she, on her part, also acted on the award and claimed absolute rights in the property assigned to her. She dealt with it. On that footing and gifted it in that right to her grandsons, the companytesting defendant on 4th April, 1929. Mutation was effect and Kishan Lal raised numberobjection. We see then that the Brijlal retained possession of property to which he was number entitled for a period of five or six years from 1884 to 1889 or 1890 and induced Mst. Mohan Dei to part with it by representing that and accepted the award and her absolute title to the rest, and after him Kishan Lal and his brother between them enjoyed the benefit of it from 1889 or 1890 down to October 1929 when Mst. Mohan Dei died. That is for a further forty, years, and led Mst. Mohan Dei to believe that they also acknowledged her title to an absolute estate. We have numberdoubt that the time Kishan Lal was also estopped fro the reason given above. Had he questioned the award and reopened the dispute Mst. Mohan Dei would at once have used and would then for forty years have obtained the benefit of property from which she was excluded because of her acceptance of the award on the faith of Brijlals assertion that he too accepted it. Kishan Lals inaction over these years with full knowledge of the facts as is evident from the deposition of the D. W. 2, Dhiyan Singh, whose testimony is uncontradicted and his acceptance of the estate with all its companysequential benefits unquestionably creates an estoppel in him. This witness tells us that - Kishanlal always accepted this award and acted upon it . He qualifies this in cross-examination by saying that the Kishan Lal had also objected to it but the witness did number know whether that was before or after Mst. Mohan Dei death. The documents filed show it was after, so there is numberreason why the main portion of his statement which is uncontradicted, and which companyld have been companytradicted, should number be accepted. In March, 1929 Mst. Mohan Deis son Shri Kishan Das died and Kishan Lal thereupon became the next presumptive reversioner, and in October, 1929 when the reversion opened out the estate vested in him, or rather would have vested in him but for the estoppel. The question therefore, is did he companytinue to be bound by the estoppel when the assumed a new character on the opening out of the reversion? We have numberdoubt he did. The decision of the Judicial Committee which we have just cited, Kanhai Lal v. Brijlal  1918  45 I.A. 118 is, we think clear on the point. Although other reversioners who do number claim through the one who has companysented are number bound the companysenting reversioner is estopped. This is beyond dispute when there is an alienation by a limited owner without legal necessity. See Ramgouda Annagouda v. Bhausaheb  1927  54 I.A. 396 at 403 where the ground of decision was - but Annagouda himself being a party to an benefiting by the transaction evidenced thereby was precluded from the questioning any part of it. In our opinion, the same principles apply to a case of the present kind. It was companytended, however, on the strength of Rangasami Gounden v. Nachiappa Gounden  1919  46 I.A. 72 and Mt. Binda Kuer v. Lalitha Prasad , that even if Kishan Lal did take possession in 1889 or 1890 on the strength of a title derived from his father. That would number have precluded him from the asserting his won rights in a different character when the succession opened out. Reliance in particular was placed upon page 308 of the latter ruling. In our opinion, that decision is to be distinguished. In that case the reversion did number fall in till 1916. Long before that, namely in 1868 the next presumptive reversioners entered into a companypromise where by the grandfather of one Jairam who figured in that case obtained a goods deal more than he would have been entitled to in the ordinary way. But for the companypromise this grandfather would have got only one anna 12 gundas share whereas due to the companypromise he got as much as 2 annas 4 gundas. The actual taking of possession was however referred under the companypromise till the death of one Anandi Kuer. She died in the 1885 and on the at date Jairam was entitled to his grandfather share as both his father and grandfather were dead. Jairam accordingly reaped the benefit of the transaction. But it is to be observed that the extra benefit which he derived was only as to a 12 gundas share because he had an absolute and indefeasible right to 1 anna 12 gundas in any event in his own right under a title which did number spring from the companypromise. Jairam lost 1 anna 4 gundas to a creditor Munniram and out of the one anna which he had left from the 2 annas 4 gundas he sold 13 gundas to the plaintiffs for a sum of Rs. 500. Now it is evident that on those facts it is impossible to predicate that the 13 gundas which the plaintiffs purchased came out of the extra 12 gundas which Jairam obtained because of the companypromise rather than out of the 1 anna 12 gundas to which he had a good and independent title anyway and of companyrse unless the plaintiff 13 gundas companyld be assigned with certainty to the 12 gundas it would be impossible to say that they had obtained any benefit from the companypromise. The Judicial Committee also added that the even if it was possible to assign this 13 gundas with certainty to the 12 gundas it by numbermeans followed that the plaintiffs admitted that fact number would that necessarily have given them a benefit under the companypromise. They had the right to companytest the position and gamble on the possibility of being able to prove the companytrary. Their Lordship added - Unless the plaintiffs individual companyduct makes it unjust that they should have a place among Bajrangi Lals reversioners their legal rights should have effect. In the other case, Rangasami Gounden v. Nachiappa Gounden  1919  46 I.A. 72, their Lordship decision about this matter turned on the same sort of point see page 87. The present case is very different. When Kishan Lal took possession of his father property he held by virtue of the award and under numberother title, and for forty years he companytinued to derive benefit from it. Accordingly he would have been estopped even if he had claimed in a different character as reversioner after the succession opened out. It was companycede that if the estoppel against Kishan Lal endured after October 1929, then the plaintiff who claim through Kishan Lal, would also be estopped. The appeal succeeds.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October 31, 1962 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Appeal No. 563 of 1959. R. Chaudhuri, for the appellants. Sen and T. Satyanarayana, for respondents Nos. 1 to 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Mitter, J. This is an appeal by special leave from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh companyfirming the decree passed by the Subordinate Judge at Eluru in O.S. No. 112 of 1955. The only question involved in this appeal is, whether, under the terms of the will of one Boddu Adilakshmi, defendants 4 and 5 took her properties as joint tenants or tenants in companymon. The facts leading to the litigation may be stated as follows. The testatrix, Adilakshmi, who was childless herself brought up defendants 4 and 5, Boddu Ramarao and Kosury Lakshmamma, from their infancy. At the date of the will executed on June 28, 1913 the girl  defendant 5  had been with her for 15 years and the boy  defendant 4  for 10 years and both were minors at the time. In order to provide for them after her death she executed a will companyering all her properties, movable and immovable. The translation of the relevant portion of the will which was in vernacular is as follows -- my entire property should hereafter my lifetime pass to. both these minors, Lakshmamma and Ramarao, that until their minority period is over, Banda Ramaswamy Garu should act as their guardian and deal with all the affairs, that after their minority period is over the entire property should be in possession of both of them, that both of them should enjoy throughout their lifetime the said property without powers of gift transfer and sale and that after their death the children that may be born to them should enjoy the same with powers of gift, transfer and sale. The testatrix died within a few days after the execution of the will. Defendants 4 and 5 divided the properties left by the testatrix by a registered partition deed dated December 27, 1929 by which those mentioned in Schedule A to the plaint fell to the share of the 4th defendant while the others mentioned in Schedule B fell to the share of the 5th defendant. The 4th defendant married the 1st defendant, Boddu Satyavathi who is the daughter of the 5th defendant. The 2nd defendant is the daughter born out of this wedlock. Some years thereafter, the 4th defendant married one Boddu Manikyam. the plaintiffs 1 to 4 being the issues of the marriage of the 4th defendant with her. The 5th defendant and the 1st defendant mortgaged the B schedule properties with the 3rd defendant who brought a suit on the mortgage and obtained a decree. The plaintiffs filed the suit against all the defendants in 1955. for a declaration that after the death praying of defendants 4-and 5, the 1st defendant and the children of the 4th defendant or such of them as may be alive at the time would be entitled to share the properties in suit equally between them and that any alienation made by defendants 4 and 5 or their assignees or alienees would number bind the interests of the ultimate feversloners beyond their lifetime and further that the mortgage decree mentioned above was number binding on the plaintiffs or the ultimate reversioners. In the trial companyrt a number of issues were framed but the only question canvassed before the High Court on appeal related to the effect of the will of Adilakshmi. The trial companyrt came to the companyclusion that defendants 4 and 5 were only the holders of life estate and that they had succeeded to the estate of Adilakshmi as tenants in companymon. The High Court held that the right of the children of defendants 4 and 5 to step into the shoes of the parents has been expressly mentioned in the instrument. The residuary estate has been given to the children. that may be bor n to the legatees who. it is provided, should enjoy the properties with powers of gift. transfer and sale. A life estate has been given to defendants 4 and 5 and an absolute estate to their children. On a fair companystruction of the language. it is difficult to accede to the companytention of the appellants that the children of defendants 4 and 5 who may be actually alive at the time of the death of defendants 4 and 5, would take the properties per capita. The High Court further held that the companyduct of the defendants in partitioning the properties went to fortify the above companyclusion. The ultimate companyclusion of the High Court was the bequest in favour of defendants 4 and 5 was that of a life estate with a vested remainder in favour of their children and that the children should take the vested remainder per stripes and number per capita. In our view. the High Court came to the companyrect companyclusion. Before examining the principles of law involved, we may companysider the intention of the testatrix in giving her properties to defendants 4 ,red 5. She brought them up like her own children but she did number want them to have the power of sale or alienation and desired that the properties be preserved for the benefit of their children. would be reasonable therefore for her to make provision in such way that the foster children would enjoy the income of the properties for their lives and that their children should inherit the Ip.C. l68 111 properties as full owners on the death of their parents. The donees of the life estate were minors at the date of the will and there was numberknowing when they would get married and how many children each would have. It would therefore be reason able to expect that the testatrix would so arrange her affairs that each of the foster children should get half of the income of the property for life and that their children should succeed to the respective interest of their parents. It is hardly likely that the testatrix would know the difference between joint tenants and tenants in companymon and she would naturally be eager to treat the foster children as her own children so that the heirs of the foster children would take share and share alike the properties be in divided per stirpes among them. Let us number companysider the position in law. The law has bee n summarised in Mullas Transfer of Property Act  Fifth Edition at page 226. As early as 1896 it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Jogeswar Narain Deo v. Ram Chand Dutt others 1  that The principle of joint tenancy appears to be unknown to Hindu law. except in the case of companyarcenary between the members of an undivided family. and that it was number right to import into the companystruction of a Hindu will an extremely technical rule of English companyveyancing. Many years later the principle was reiterated in the case of Babu Rani v. Rajendra Baksh Singh 2 . It was argued before us that there were indications in the will that the intention of the testatrix was that the foster children should take as joint tenants and that this was apparent from the clause in the will which provided that the entire property should be in possession of both of them and that both of them should enjoy throughout their lifetime the said property and that after their death the children that may be born to them should enjoy the same We do number think that from this one can spell out a joint tenancy which is unknown to Hindu law except as above stated. The testatrix did number expressly mention that on the death of one all the properties would pass to the other by right of survivorship. We have numberdoubt on a companystruction of the will that the testatrix never intended the foster children to take the property as joint tenants. The foster children who became tenants in companymon partitioned the property in exercise of their right.  1  23 I.A. 37 at 44.  2  60 l.A.95 at 10 As by the will the foster children were to have a life interest with a vested remainder to their children, the latter companyld only take per stirpes and number per capita. As Halsbury points out  Volume 39--Third Edition  at page 1106, Art. 1638 that a stirpital distribution would be adopted where the gift was to a number of parents and their children in such a manner that the children were substituted for, or took on the death of, their respective parents and gifts to several parents and at, or after, their deaths to their children, or to their issue, have received this companystruction as meaning at or after their respective deaths. It is number necessary to cite many instances where this companystruction has been adopted. In re Hutchinsons Trusts 1  the testatrix bequeathed personality in trust for A.B. for life and after his decease for his issue, and on failure of his issue to F.H.S. and R.S. share and share alike, and after the decease of the said F.H.S. and R.S. to their children share and share alike, and to their heirs for ever. Kay, J. felt that he was bound by authority to say that the words after the decease of the said Francis Hutchinson Synge and his brother Robert Synge mean after their respective deaths, or after the decease of each of them, and that there is a disposition of the share of each which was an absolute interest in the first instance upon his death.  see at page 816 . This rule was further amplified by Romer. J. in Errington, In re. Gibbs v. Lassam 1  where he said  at p. 425  The rule, stated in its simplest way is this Where a testator gives the income of his estate to two people, A. and B., for their lives and follows that gift by a direction that at their death, or at their deaths, or at or after the death or deaths of A. and B. the property is to go to their issue, the Court does number companystrue the gift as a gift only to take effect on the death of both in favour of the issue of both, but companystrues it as a gift, to take effect on the death of each, of the share to the income of which the deceased was entitled, to the issue of the deceased.  1  21 Ch. D. 11.  2  1927 1 Ch.\",\n          \"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 2720 of 1972. From the Judgment and order dated 29/30-8-72 of the Gujarat High Court in Special Civil Appeal No. 315 of 1971. U. Mehta and M.N. Goswami for the Appellant. Vimal Dave, M.N. Shroff and KMM Khan for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA, J. This is an Appeal against the judgment of a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dismissing a writ petition filed by the Appellant herein. The Appeal has been filed on a certificate of fitness granted by the Gujarat High Court under Article 133 1  c  of the Constitution. The main challenge in the writ petition was to the vires of sections 4 and 6 respectively of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. That challenge numberlonger survives in view of the validity of the sections having been upheld by this Court in Manubhai Jehtalal Patel and Anr. v. State of Gujarat and others, 1983 4 S.C.C. 553. The lands in question are situated at village Bhairav, Taluka Kamrege, District Surat, Gujarat. The said lands are situated on the bank of the river Tapti which is known for its frequent floods and the lands are companyered in Survey No. 2. The said lands admeasure 1 acre and 39 gunthas. We propose to refer to the said lands in the aggregate as the said land. The said land is also known as the Maksheshwar Mahadev Land. The Appellant claims to be the occupant and owner of the entire land companyprising in Survey No. 2 which includes the said land. It may be mentioned that the claim of the Appellant to be the owner and Occupier of the said land is based on his being the senior member of his family but we are number companycerned with that question as we propose to proceed on the footing that he is in actual occupation of the said land. The preliminary numberification declaring the intention to acquire the said land was issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and published in the Government Gazette of the State of Gujarat on April 30, 1970. It was numberified that the proposed acquisition was for a public purpose, namely, for extension of the village site of the village Bhairav. It is companymon ground that the extension of the village site was required for the purpose of housing 12 families who had been rendered homeless because of floods in Tapti river. An individual numberice under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was served on the Appellant on May 2, 1970. The Appellant filed his objections against the proposed acquisition on May 12, 1970 and filed additional objections on June 20, 1970 and July 6, 1970 respectively. After companysideration and rejection of the said objections, the numberification for acquisition of the lands under section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued on December 8, 1970. Notices under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act were issued on January 8, 1971. The said acquisition was challenged by the Appellant in the writ petition on various grounds. The main ground on which the said acquisition was challenged in the writ petition was that the provisions of sections 4 and 6 respectively of the Land Acquisition Act were ultra vires the Constitution of India. That challenge, as we have already pointed out, has been finally negatived by this Court. In view of this, Mr. Mehta fairly companyceded that the vires of sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act companyld numberlonger be called in question before us. It was, however, pointed out by him that the said numberification was also challenged on some other grounds. It was companytended by Mr. Mehta that under the provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, it must be established that the lands in the existing village site are insufficient for the extension of the village site before any acquisition can be resorted to. It was submitted by Mr. Mehta that before the said land companyld be acquired for the afforested public purpose, the revenue authorities should have satisfied themselves that there were numberunoccupied lands in the village which were suitable, appropriate and available for the extension of the village site or abadi and since that has number been done, the acquisition companyld number said to be for a public purpose. Mr. Mehta sought support for these submissions from the decision of a Division Bench of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in Chandrabhagabai Undha- orao and others v. Commissioner, Nagpur Division, Nagpur Ors.,1962 Nagpur Law Journal, Vol. XLV at p. 466. It was held in that case that the provisions of section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code require that the Deputy Commissioner of the District or any other person authorised under law by him must record a finding that the village abadi is insufficient and that there is numberother unoccupied land suitable for the purpose of extension of the village abadi before land companyld be companypulsorily acquired for that purpose. The decision as to the sufficiency or otherwise of the land in the abadi must be taken by the Deputy Commissioner. The Land Acquisition officer cannot substitute his opinion for that of the Deputy Commissioner in purporting to companyply with the provisions of section 226. Reliance was also placed by Mr. Mehta on the decision of a Division Bench  Nagpur  of the Bombay High Court, in Sitaram Maroti v. State of Maharashtra, 1963 65 Bombay Law Reporter, 241 which is to the same effect as the aforesaid decision and, in fact, follows it. It was submitted by Mr. Mehta that the provisions of section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code were substantially similar to the provisions of section 126 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code which is really the provision applicable to the lands in question before us. We are totally unable to accept the submission of Mr Mehta that the provisions referred to above are in pari materia. Section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code provides as follows 226.  1  Where the area reserved for abadi is in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner insufficient, he may reserve such further area from the unoccupied land in the village as he may think fit. Where unoccupied land for purposes of abadi is number available, the State Government may acquire any land for the extension of abadi and the Deputy Commissioner shall dispose of such land on such terms and companyditions as may be prescribed. The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall apply to such acquisition and companypensation shall be payable for the acquisition of such land in accordance with the provisions in that Act. A perusal of the said section shows that before the State Government acquires any land for extension of abadi, the Deputy Commissioner has to give his opinion that the area reserved for abadi in the village in question in insufficient. A reading of sub-section  2  of the said section shows that it is only where unoccupied land for the purpose of abadi is number available, that the State can acquire any land for extension of abadi. Sub-section  3  merely makes the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act applicable to the procedure for acquisition and for determining the companypensation. The provisions of section 126 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879 read altogether differently. The said section runs as follows Limits of sites of villages, towns and cities how to be fixed. It shall be lawful for the Collector or for a survey officer, acting under the general or special orders of the State Government, to determine what lands are included within the site of any village, town, or city, and to fix, and from time to time to vary the limits of the same, respect being had to all subsisting rights of landholders. A perusal of section 126 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code shows that unlike section 226 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, there is numberhing in section 126 which indicates that the Collector or a Survey officer acting under his orders has to first decide to enlarge or vary the site of any village, town or city before acquisition is resorted to for enlarging or varying such site under the Act. Section 126 merely deals with the limits of the site of any village, town or city and prescribes the procedure for fixing the limits of such sites. There is numberhing in the Bombay Land Revenue Code or the Land Acquisition Act which would suggest that before acquisition can be resorted to for enlarging a village site, the Collector or a Survey officer or Revenue Authority must decide upon such enlargement. Great emphasis was laid by Mr. Mehta on the last part of section 126 which shows that the enlargement of the site has to be made, keeping in mind the rights of the landholders. However, in our opinion, this factor is of numberrelevance in the present case as there is numberhing on record to establish that such rights have number been taken into account. The next submission of Mr. Mehta was that the land acquisition authorities have failed to companysider what were the other lands available which companyld have been more companyveniently acquired for the public purpose referred to earlier. It was pointed out by him that in the writ petition, the Appellant  petitioner  has alleged that he companyld have pointed out certain other lands and open spaces where the twelve families rendered homeless by the floods of Tapti river companyld have been housed. With reference to these allegations, the Respondents in their companynter-affidavit filed before the Gujarat High Court have rightly pointed out that the Appellant had number given any details regarding other more suitable lands available for acquisition and hence it was number open to him to make a grievance on that score. Moreover, in paragraph 29 of the companynter-affidavit, the Respondents have pointed out that the lands referred to by the Appellant in his petition were number suitable for housing the victims of the floods because they were lowlying lands lands and number suitable for residential purposes. The assessment of suitability of the land proposed to be acquired for the companycerned public purpose is primarily for the Land Acquisition officer companysider and numbergood reason has been shown to us which companyld warrant interference with his decision. Moreover, we are satisfied that the Appellant had number even given proper particulars of the other lands which, according to him, were available for acquisition and were more suitable for acquisition and hence he can make numbergrievance on the score of proper companysideration number having been given to the question of acquiring such lands. It was lastly submitted by Mr. Mehta that since several years had passed from the date of the Notification under section 4, the victims of the floods must have been housed and rehabilitated elsewhere and hence the public purpose for which the lands were sought to be acquired does number survive. We are a little surprised at this argument. The delay has taken place on account of the legal proceedings adopted by the Appellant himself and by reason of the interim orders obtained by him. He cannot take advantage of this delay and claim that the public purpose numberlonger survives. Moreover, the public purpose stated in the Notification is the extension of a village site or goathan of the village Bhairav and there is numberhing to show that this public purpose has exhausted itself. In fact, we presume, on account of the increasing population, it will be more necessary today that the village site should be extended even then it was the time when the numberification was issued. This submission must also fail. The other companytroversies sought to be raised by the Appellant are factual in nature and we do number companysider it necessary to go into the same.\",\n          \" Bose, J. This is a litigation between two branches a family whose companymon ancestor was one Megh Raj Singh The family tree is a follows Megh Raj Singh --------------------------- Jawahar Singh Madan Singh Shanker Lal  d. 1884  Brijlal  d. 1890  Daughter Mst. Mohan Dei Oct. 1929  Kishan Lal Mahabir Prasad Husband Narain Das  d. 21-5-1940   d. 1921  Shri Kishan Das Mst. Deoki Jugal Kishore Amar Nath March 1929   d. 1894  Plff 1. Plff 2. Dhiyan Singh Jai Bhagwan Singh Deft. 1 Deft. 2 Ghas Ram Onkar Prasad The dispute is about property which, according to the plaintiffs, formed part of Shanker Lals estate. The plaintiffs state that the two branches of family were separate at all material times that on Shanker Lals death in 1884 his daughter Mst. Mohan Dei  the defendants grandmother  succeeded to a limited estate. The reversion opened out on her death in October 1929 and the plaintiff are entitled as the next reversioners, for Mst. Mohan Deis son Shri Kishan Das predeceased her. The defendants admits that Shanker Lal was separate from the other branch of the family. They divide the property which their grandmother Mst. Mohan Dei possessed into two categories. First, there was property which they say belonged to her. These are properties which according to them, she purchased or obtained under the mortgages in her own right. Next, there were properties which belonged exclusively to her father and to which she succeeded as daughter. On Shanker Lals death disputes arose between Shanker Lals fathers brothers son Brijlal  the plaintiffs grandfather  and the defendants grandmother Mst. Mohan Dei. Brijlal claimed the entire estate by survivorship, his allegation being that Shanker Lal dies in a state of jointness with him and that all the properties were joint family properties. This dispute was referred to arbitration and an award was delivered. Under the Mst. Mohan Dei was given the suit properties as absolute owner and the rest of the estate then in dispute was given to Brijlal. A division was effected accordingly and ever since, that is to say from 21-12-1884, the date of the award, down to 26-3-1941, the date of the suit, each branch has been in separate and uninterrupted possession of the properties respectively allotted to it and each has been dealing with them as absolute owner. The defendants claim that the plaintiff are bound by this award and are in any event estopped. The plaintiff lost in the first Court but won in the High Court. The defendants appeal. The first question is about the nature of the award. The defendants say that it gave Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute estate. The plaintiff deny this and say she obtained only a limited estate. In our opinion, the defendants are rights. The question at issue a simple one of companystruction. The award is Ex. A-1. The operative portion runs thus Having regard to the specifications give above, Brij Lal, first party, and Musammat Mohan Devi, the deceaseds female issue, second party, have been held entitled to shares, worth Rs. 28,500 and Rs. 42,482-10-0 respectively in the said properties and accordingly two lost have been made and the first lot is allotted to the first party and the second lot to the second party and hence forth the parties shall have number claim or liability against each other and each party has become permanent owner  malik mustaqil  of his or her share and reach party should enter in proprietary possession and occupation of his or her respective share The underlining is ours. We do number think the words admit of any doubt, particularly as the words malik mustaqil have been used see Ram Gopal v. Nand Lal and Other  1950  S.C.R. 766 at 778  and Bishunath Prasad Singh v. Chandika Prasad Kumari   1933 60 I.A. 56 at 61 62 . But it was argued that the awards must be viewed as a whole and that certain earlier passages show that his companyld number have been the intention. The passages relied on are these. First, the finding that the properties claimed by Mst. Mohan Dei as her own really belonged to Shanker Lal. He had purchased some and acquired others through mortgages in her name but he was only a benamidar and had numbertitle to them. Second, that some of the properties, in dispute were ancestral and the rest self acquired, though whether with the held of ancestral funds or number the arbitrator was unable to determine. Third, the arbitrators view of the Hindu law, namely that - The brother should be the owner of the joint ancestral property and the daughter who has a male issue should be owner of the self-acquired property. And lastly, this passage - Furthermore, when the 2nd party  Mohan Dei  has inherited numberproperty from the her husband she, in case of getting, this share, will certainly settled down in the Amroha and will make her fathers haveli as her abode and thus the haveli shall remain abad as heretofore, and in this way the deceased name will be perpetuated and it is positive that, after the Musammat, this property shall devolve on her son, who will be the malik  owner  thereof, and later the descendant of this son will become the owner thereof. We do number think these passages qualify the operative portion of the award and are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the High Court who hold they do. In our opinion, the arbitrator was companyfused in his mind both as regards the facts as well as regards the law. His view of the law may have been wrong but the words used are, in our opinion, clear and, in the absence of anything which would unambiguously qualify them, we must interpret them in their usual sense. Some cases were cited in which the word malik, and in one case the words malik mustaqil were held to import a limited estate because of the qualifying circumstances. We think it would be pointless to the examine them because we are companycerned here with the documents before us and even if it be companyceded that the words which would ordinarily means one thing can be qualified by other words and circumstances appearing in the same documents we are of opinion that the passages and circumstances relied on in this case do number qualify the strong, clear and unambiguous words used in this documents. The learned companynsel for the plaintiffs-respondents had to search diligently for the meaning for which he companytended in other passages and had to make several assumptions which do number appear on the face of the awards as to what the arbitrator must have thought and must have intended. We are number prepared to qualify clear and unambiguous languages by phrases of the lubious import which can be made to companyncide with either view by calling in aid assumptions of fact about whose existence we can only guess. The award was attacked on other grounds also. It was urged, among other things, that the arbitrator had travelled beyond the terms of his reference in awarding Mst Mohan Dei an absolute interest. It was also urged that even if Brijlal was bound his son Kishan Lal, who did number claim through him but who had an independent title as reversioner to Shanker Lal, would number be bound, and it was companytended that if Kishan Lal was number bound the plaintiffs would number be either. But we need number examine these points because we do number need to proceed on the binding nature of the award. Even if the award be invalid we are of the opinion that the plaintiffs claims is companypletely answered by the plea of estoppel. Now it can be companyceded that the before an estoppel can arise, there must be first a representation of an existing fact as distinct from a mere promise de future made by one party to the other second that the other party, believing it, must have been induced to act on the faith of it and third, that he must have so acted to his detriment. It will be necessary to deal with the in stages and first we will companysider whether there was any estoppel against Brijlal. It is beyond dispute that he laid serious claim to the property in 1884. He claimed that he was joint with Shanker Lal and so, on Shanker Lals death he became entitled to the whole of the estate and that Mst. Mohan Dei had only a right of maintenance. Whether he would have had difficulty in establishing such a claim, or indeed whether it would have been impossible for him to do so, is wholly immaterial. The fact remains that he pressed his claim and was serious about it so must so that he was able to pursue the arbitrator that he had an immediate right to part of the estate. Mst. Mohan Dei, on the other hand, resisted this claim and companytended that she was entitled to separate and exclusive possession, and in any event that she was entitled in absolute right to a part of the property. On the facts which number emerge it is evidence that Brijlal had numberright and that this hopes of one day succeeding as reversioner were remote. Mst. Mohan Dei had a son Shri Kishan Das who was the next presumptive reversioner and as the boy was a goods deal younger than Brijlal Brijlals chances were slim. Actually, the boy survived Brijlal by the nearly forty years. Brijlal died in 1889 or 1890 and the boy did number die till March. 1929. Had he lived another eight or nine months he would have succeeded and the plaintiffs would have been numberhere. Now this dispute, seriously pressed by both sides, was referred to arbitration. It is neither here number there whether the award was valid. Whether the decision fell within the scope of the reference or whether it had any binding character in itself. Even if it was wholly invalid it was still open to the parties to say Never mind whether the arbitrator was right or wrong, his decision is fair and sensible so instead of wasting further time and money in useless litigation, we will accept it and divide the estate in accordance with his findings. That would have been a perfectly right and proper settlement of the dispute and whether it bound third parties or number it would certainly bind the immediate parties and that in effect is what they did. By his companyduct Brijlal induced Mst. Mohan Dei to believe that this would be the case and on the faith of that representation, namely, the acceptance of the award, he induced Mst. Mohan Dei to act greatly to her detriment and to alter her position by accepting the award and parting with an appreciable portion of the estate, and he himself obtained and substantial advantage to which he would number otherwise have been entitled and enjoyed the benefit of it for the rest of his life, and to his credit be it said he never attempted to go behind his decision. In any event, we are clear that that created an estoppel as against Brijlal. In our opinion, the present case is very similar to the one which their Lordship of the Privy Council decided in Kanhai Lal v. Brij Lal   1919  45 I.A. 118 . There also there was a dispute between a limited owner and a person who but for an unproved claim  adoption  which he put forward, had numberright to the estate. The dispute was taken to the companyrts but was companypromised and the according to the agreement the property was divided between the two rival claimants and the agreement was given effect to and acted on for a period of twenty years. Later, the succession opened out and the other party to the companypromise, who by then had stepped into the reversion, claimed the rest of the estate, which had been assigned to the limited owner, against, her personal heirs. The Judicial Committee rejected the claim on the ground of estoppel and held that even though the plaintiff claimed in a different character in the suit, namely, as reversioner, he having been a party to the companypromise and having acted on it and induced the other side to alter her position to her detriment, was estopped. We do number think the fact that there was a voluntary companypromise whereas here there was the imposed decision of an arbitrator makes any difference because we are number proceedings on the footing of the award but on the actings of the parties in accepting it when they need number have done so if the present companytentions are companyrect. It is true that in one sense a question of title is one of law and it is equally true that there can be numberestoppel on a question of law must be grounded on facts and when Brijlals companyduct is analysed it will be found to entail an assertion by him that he admitted and recognised facts which would in law give Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the lands awarded to her. It was because of that the assertion of the fact, namely, his recognition, and admission of the existence of facts which would give Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute interest that she was induced to part with about one-third of the property to which Brijlal on a true estimate of the facts as number known had number right. There can be numberdoubt that she acted to her detriment and there can, we think, be equally numberdoubt that she was induced to do so on the faith of the Brijlals statement and companyduct which induced her to believe that he accepted all the implications of the award. But in any event, we are clear that Brijlal would have been estopped. The nature of the dispute and the description of its given in the award show that the there was companysiderable doubt, and certainly much dispute about the true state of affairs. Even if the arbitrator was wholly wrong and even if he had numberpower to decide as he did it was open to both sides to the accept the decision and by their acceptance recognise the existence of facts which would in law give the other an absolute estate in the properties they agreed to divide among themselves and did divide. That tin our opinion is a representation of an existing fact or set of facts. Each would companysequently be estopped as against the other and Brijlal in particular would have been estopped from denying the existence of facts which would give Mst. Mohan Dei and absolute interest in the suit property. We turn next to his son Kishan Lal. Brijlal died in 1889 or 1890. at that date Mst. Mohan Deis son Shri Kishan Das was alive and was the next presumptive reversioner. Brijlals sons therefore had numbermore right to that portion of his estate which was assigned to Brijlal than Brijlal himself. But they took possession and claimed through their father. They did number claim an independent title in themselves. and, as we know, they had numberother title at that date. They were therfore in numberbetter position than Brijlal and as Brijlal would have been estopped, the estoppel descended to them also because they stepped into his shoes. This would be so even if Brijlal had claimed the property independently for himself which he did number but much more so as he claimed in joint family right and evidently acted as karta or manager on behalf of his family. But apart from this, there was also an independent estoppel in Kishan Lal. We have said, he had numberright of the this part to this part of the estate when his father died apart from the award. But nevertheless he took possession along with his brother and the two of them treated the property as their own and derived benefit from it. They partitioned the estate between themselves and sold away parts of it to third parties. Kishan Lal knew of the award. He knew that mutation had been effected in accordance with it and possession taken by Brijlal under it and that the rest had been retained by Mst. Mohan Dei. His retention of the property therefore and his companytinuing to deal with it on the basis of the award indicated his own acceptance of the award and therefore, by his acts and companyducts, he represented and he also, like his father, admitted the existence of facts which would in law give Mst. Mohan Dei an absolute estate and futher, he allowed Mst. Mohan Dei to deal with the estate as her own, for she, on her part, also acted on the award and claimed absolute rights in the property assigned to her. She dealt with it. On that footing and gifted it in that right to her grandsons, the companytesting defendant on 4th April, 1929. Mutation was effect and Kishan Lal raised numberobjection. We see then that the Brijlal retained possession of property to which he was number entitled for a period of five or six years from 1884 to 1889 or 1890 and induced Mst. Mohan Dei to part with it by representing that and accepted the award and her absolute title to the rest, and after him Kishan Lal and his brother between them enjoyed the benefit of it from 1889 or 1890 down to October 1929 when Mst. Mohan Dei died. That is for a further forty, years, and led Mst. Mohan Dei to believe that they also acknowledged her title to an absolute estate. We have numberdoubt that the time Kishan Lal was also estopped fro the reason given above. Had he questioned the award and reopened the dispute Mst. Mohan Dei would at once have used and would then for forty years have obtained the benefit of property from which she was excluded because of her acceptance of the award on the faith of Brijlals assertion that he too accepted it. Kishan Lals inaction over these years with full knowledge of the facts as is evident from the deposition of the D. W. 2, Dhiyan Singh, whose testimony is uncontradicted and his acceptance of the estate with all its companysequential benefits unquestionably creates an estoppel in him. This witness tells us that - Kishanlal always accepted this award and acted upon it . He qualifies this in cross-examination by saying that the Kishan Lal had also objected to it but the witness did number know whether that was before or after Mst. Mohan Dei death. The documents filed show it was after, so there is numberreason why the main portion of his statement which is uncontradicted, and which companyld have been companytradicted, should number be accepted. In March, 1929 Mst. Mohan Deis son Shri Kishan Das died and Kishan Lal thereupon became the next presumptive reversioner, and in October, 1929 when the reversion opened out the estate vested in him, or rather would have vested in him but for the estoppel. The question therefore, is did he companytinue to be bound by the estoppel when the assumed a new character on the opening out of the reversion? We have numberdoubt he did. The decision of the Judicial Committee which we have just cited, Kanhai Lal v. Brijlal  1918  45 I.A. 118 is, we think clear on the point. Although other reversioners who do number claim through the one who has companysented are number bound the companysenting reversioner is estopped. This is beyond dispute when there is an alienation by a limited owner without legal necessity. See Ramgouda Annagouda v. Bhausaheb  1927  54 I.A. 396 at 403 where the ground of decision was - but Annagouda himself being a party to an benefiting by the transaction evidenced thereby was precluded from the questioning any part of it. In our opinion, the same principles apply to a case of the present kind. It was companytended, however, on the strength of Rangasami Gounden v. Nachiappa Gounden  1919  46 I.A. 72 and Mt. Binda Kuer v. Lalitha Prasad , that even if Kishan Lal did take possession in 1889 or 1890 on the strength of a title derived from his father. That would number have precluded him from the asserting his won rights in a different character when the succession opened out. Reliance in particular was placed upon page 308 of the latter ruling. In our opinion, that decision is to be distinguished. In that case the reversion did number fall in till 1916. Long before that, namely in 1868 the next presumptive reversioners entered into a companypromise where by the grandfather of one Jairam who figured in that case obtained a goods deal more than he would have been entitled to in the ordinary way. But for the companypromise this grandfather would have got only one anna 12 gundas share whereas due to the companypromise he got as much as 2 annas 4 gundas. The actual taking of possession was however referred under the companypromise till the death of one Anandi Kuer. She died in the 1885 and on the at date Jairam was entitled to his grandfather share as both his father and grandfather were dead. Jairam accordingly reaped the benefit of the transaction. But it is to be observed that the extra benefit which he derived was only as to a 12 gundas share because he had an absolute and indefeasible right to 1 anna 12 gundas in any event in his own right under a title which did number spring from the companypromise. Jairam lost 1 anna 4 gundas to a creditor Munniram and out of the one anna which he had left from the 2 annas 4 gundas he sold 13 gundas to the plaintiffs for a sum of Rs. 500. Now it is evident that on those facts it is impossible to predicate that the 13 gundas which the plaintiffs purchased came out of the extra 12 gundas which Jairam obtained because of the companypromise rather than out of the 1 anna 12 gundas to which he had a good and independent title anyway and of companyrse unless the plaintiff 13 gundas companyld be assigned with certainty to the 12 gundas it would be impossible to say that they had obtained any benefit from the companypromise. The Judicial Committee also added that the even if it was possible to assign this 13 gundas with certainty to the 12 gundas it by numbermeans followed that the plaintiffs admitted that fact number would that necessarily have given them a benefit under the companypromise. They had the right to companytest the position and gamble on the possibility of being able to prove the companytrary. Their Lordship added - Unless the plaintiffs individual companyduct makes it unjust that they should have a place among Bajrangi Lals reversioners their legal rights should have effect. In the other case, Rangasami Gounden v. Nachiappa Gounden  1919  46 I.A. 72, their Lordship decision about this matter turned on the same sort of point see page 87. The present case is very different. When Kishan Lal took possession of his father property he held by virtue of the award and under numberother title, and for forty years he companytinued to derive benefit from it. Accordingly he would have been estopped even if he had claimed in a different character as reversioner after the succession opened out. It was companycede that if the estoppel against Kishan Lal endured after October 1929, then the plaintiff who claim through Kishan Lal, would also be estopped. The appeal succeeds. The decree of the High Court is set aside and that of the first Court dismissing the plaintiffs claim is restored.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5077,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"split\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"train\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1978_225.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5082,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
